<p class='c007'>At first introduced to indicate the supposed results of pus and
septic material respectively in the blood, these terms have come
to represent the clinical phenomena which come from the introduction
into a susceptible system of pyogenic and necrogenic
microbes and their toxic products. Gradually different affections,
which would have been included under the same general terms,
came to be identified under specific names, and a number of these
will be described as individual diseases—strangles, mouse and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>rabbit septicæmias, metritis, phlebitis, omphalitis, rouget, barbone,
chicken cholera, septicæmia hæmorrhagica, etc.—yet a
certain number have been left to be referred to under the generic
terms, though respectively due to different microbes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Distinctions between Pyæmia and Septicæmia.</i> <i>Pyæmia</i> is a
morbid condition characterized by the formation in different
organs of multiple metastatic abscesses, dependent on the transference,
in the blood stream, of infected clots, or particles containing
pus microbes, and their arrest at distant points, so as to
cause foci of suppuration commencing with the intima of the
vessels.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Septicæmia</i> indicates a general infection often by the same microbes,
but showing its results in enlargement and blood engorgement
of the spleen and lymph glands and necrotic foci of the
liver, kidneys and other organs, but without the formation of
multiple abscesses. The presence of the microbes in the different
organs affected, shows that it is not due to the diffusion of the
toxic chemical products alone, as at one time supposed, and the
lack of abscesses appears to be due to the absence of clots or of
modified and adhesive leucocytes or hæmatoblasts, which adhering
to the epithelium of the vessels predispose to suppuration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two conditions are, however, often combined, constituting
what is known as <i>septico-pyæmia</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As in the occurrence of other infecting diseases, the condition
of varying susceptibility must be taken into account, one individual,
or one species resisting an inoculation which would be
deadly to another.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Pyæmia.</b> <i>Causes.</i> The causation microbes are most commonly
staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, or albus, the streptococcus
pyogenes, and less frequently bacillus pyocyaneus, bacterium coli
commune, and probably any pus producing microbe. Many conditions
must however be accepted as contributing to the general
infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inoculation on a mere abrasion or surface sore is not to be
dreaded so much as if the virus is lodged <i>subcutaneously or in a
deep wound</i>. The ready escape of the toxic products, the active
leucocytosis which takes place in the granulations, and the action
of the oxygen of the air are more or less protective in the exposed
sores.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>The native <i>susceptibility of the subject</i>,—horse, ox,—conduces
to the disease, while the insusceptibility,—bird—tends to obviate it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>debility of the system or of individual tissues attacked</i>, lowers
the resistant power, and especially that of leucocytosis, and thus
favors survival and encrease of the microbes and their chemical
products. Thus the <i>shock</i> succeeding a serious operation, the
general depression attendant upon severe illness, or the poisoning
by narcotizing ptomaines and toxins, may easily become the extra
weight which causes the system to succumb. On the contrary,
pre-existing or long standing disease, with consequent general
debility appears at times to prove to some extent a protective
factor, the previous exposure to the invading germ having educated
the leucocytes to resist the toxins and to produce the defensive
sera which neutralize the latter or keep the invading microbes
in check. A measure of immunization has been secured.</p>

<p class='c008'>The resulting immunization cannot be looked on as very perfect,
nor permanent, as a specially strong inoculation by a
virulent microbe, or large dose, or different conditions of life,
will entirely overcome it, and the pyæmic fever appears. Yet
in chronic cases of secondary abscesses from a deep source of
infection, the resistance is often such as to ward off febrile
pyæmia. In a horse with primary abscess situated deeply under
the humerus, free evacuation and healing of the wound, have, in
my experience, been followed by the formation of abscesses in
distant points for a period of seven years, but without any
marked febrile reaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>complex nature of the infection</i> appears at times to overcome
the vital resistance more effectively than will the presence
of even a potent microbe alone. Some of the worst cases follow
on a wound, the seat of complex infection, and even saprophytes
are to be dreaded in this connection. This may operate in various
ways, either by mutual combinations or decompositions of
the toxic products of associated germs producing more deleterious
products, or by the individual action of one ptomain or toxin on
leucocytes, hæmatoblasts, sera, or tissue, laying it more open to
the attacks of those of another microbe which by itself would
have been comparatively harmless.</p>

<p class='c008'>Koch’s experiments showed that the <i>attack is violent in ratio
with the size of the dose</i>: one-thousandth part of a drop of pyæmic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>blood was harmless to the rabbit, while one tenth of a drop killed
in one hundred and twenty-five hours, and a syringe full in forty
hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>In ordinary cases of pyæmia the occurrence of internal <i>phlebitis</i>
or <i>arteritis</i> with the inevitable thrombosis is an important step in
causation. Any inflammation of the inner coat of the vessel leads
promptly to the formation of a coagulation of the contained blood,
and blocking of the lumen. Beginning on the diseased or
abraded surface, the clot forms backward along the line from
which the blood normally comes (proximal in the arteries; distal,
in the veins), until it reaches the next considerable colateral
branch. The clot is firmly adherent to the intima except at the
free end, which is conical and projects into the blood current.</p>

<p class='c008'>If small portions are detached from the thrombus and washed
on in the blood stream they become arrested when they reach a
vessel too small to admit them, it may be a smaller artery, or it
may be a capillary, and always in the line of the circulation,—from
the systemic circulation to the lungs, or from the lungs to
the system at large. This is <b>embolism</b>. Wherever arrested, the
contact of the leucocytes and hæmatoblasts with the inner coat of
the vessel, leads to metabolic changes and firm adhesion, and the
pus microbes in the clot determine suppuration and abscess.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eberth and Schimmelbusch have shown that the hæmatoblasts,
even more than the other blood elements, when acted on by the
pus microbes become viscous and stick not only to each other,
but to any floating body, and to the inner serous coat of the
vessel, particularly when the latter has been abraded or injured.
This clumping together of the hæmatoblasts forms white clots
which block the smaller vessels, but in the viscous condition they
further the coagulation of the fibrine, and again when they come in
contact with the intima, instead of passing through, or moving on,
they remain adherent and start the formation of thrombi. This
is above all common in given tissues, and the medulla of bone
has in this respect a bad preëminence, so that acute suppurative
osteomyelitis, is a familiar lesion and is liable to become chronic,
and determine distant abscesses and general infection long after.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thrombus thus formed is an infective coagulum, tending
to constant encrease, as the clot is a favorable culture-field for
the microbes, and the tendency is to coagulate more and more of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the adjacent blood. It tends further to disintegration, as the
action of the microbes and their toxins on the leucocytes, transforms
these into pus cells, inducing softening of the mass, and
the washing on of individual infective pus cells and minute portions
of the clot to form infective centres and abscesses at distant
parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the pathogenesis of the invading microbe is weak and the
resistance of the leucocytes potent, such clots may remain circumscribed
or may even be absorbed, but in the opposite conditions
with potent and numerous microbes and abundant and effective
toxins, the disposition is not only to a continuance of infection,
but to an acute febrile pyæmia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pyæmia does not supervene at once upon a trauma as may
septicæmia, but only after a variable number of days, (3 to 8),
a peculiarity which is explained by the temporary protection of
the clot. By the constant accretions on its exterior, of the new
layers of hæmatoblasts and fibrin, the microbes are at first imprisoned,
and it is only when softening has taken place, or when the
coagulum has extended into the free flowing current passing into
a colateral trunk, that the infection is liable to be washed on in
dangerous amount.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mere presence of pus microbes or their toxins in the blood,
does not determine pyæmia: a modification of the intima of the
vessels leading to local infections with thrombosis or embolism
and abscess is an essential condition. This lesion of the vessels
may be a trauma, as from bruise, puncture, operation, ligature, or
it may be the extension of a disease process as in arteritis, phlebitis,
atheroma, the growth of a tumor from adjacent tissues, or
parasitism. The seat of the secondary abscess depends primarily
on the location of the original suppurating centre. As such centres
are most commonly in the systemic circulation (osteomyelitis,
omphalitis, wounds, traumas) the lungs are most commonly
attacked, the pulmonary capillaries acting as a sieve and arresting
the floating infective coagula. When the primary infection comes
from the chylo-poietic viscera, the liver is likely to show the first
crop of secondary abscesses. When, on the other hand, the primary
abscess is in the lungs, the great flow of blood through the
kidney renders it especially subject to secondary suppurating foci,
though these may form in any part of the body.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><i>Lesions.</i> Pyæmia may result from a wound or abscess in connection
with which will usually be found a vein containing a
thrombus more or less softened or liquefied. If from a deep seated
injury or from osteomyelitis, the same condition is met with. The
thrombus and circulating blood furnish abundance of the infective
microbes, and at distant points, in the complimentary circulation,
most commonly in the lungs the arteries are found to be the seats
of <i>embolism</i> from arrested clots. The arrest always takes place
where the vessels are diminished by bifurcation, or the giving off
of a considerable colateral trunk, and the appearances will depend
on the duration of the embolism. If quite recent, a wedge-shaped
mass of tissue supplied by the vessel is ischæmic and pale, its
blood passing on into the veins without further arterial supply; if
later, this tissue forms an <i>infarct</i> being gorged with deep red or
black blood which has filtered in from adjacent anostomosing capillaries
and distended those of the exsanguine area. This area
becomes of a deep red or black color, consolidated by an exudate
of lymph, and rapidly invaded by suppuration. The microbes
determine suppuration and softening, first in the clot and intima,
and next in the outer coats of the vessel and the surrounding exudate,
so that an abscess of variable size may result. Abscesses
are usually smaller and more numerous in the acute forms of the
disease, and larger and less numerous in the more chronic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ulcerative endocarditis with coagula on the valves is not uncommon.
The spleen is often the seat of small abscesses in the
centre of solid exudates, with in many cases softening and enlargement
of the organ. The blood tends to retain its normal bright
red color, and clots firmly, contrary to the usual condition in
septicæmia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The formation of emboli and secondary abscess is
usually marked by a violent rigor, lasting from a few minutes to
an hour and which may be repeated at irregular intervals, serving,
in some measure, to distinguish pyæmia from septicæmia. The
temperature rises with the rigor, (102° to 105°) but shows marked
remissions especially in the morning, when it may not exceed the
normal, and rising again with the recurrence of chill or staring
coat. The pulse is usually encreased in frequency even during
the remissions and is soft and compressible. Remissions may be
attended by profuse perspirations or even, in the advanced stages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>by fœtid diarrhœa. The breath has a peculiar sweetish or mawkish
odor. Blood passed with the fæces may indicate intestinal
abscess, and albumen or pus in the acid urine, bespeaks suppurating
foci in the kidney. The cloudy mucus from the pelvis of
the kidney in the horse must not be mistaken for this. Cough or
dyspnœa will indicate abscess of the lungs, and intercostal tenderness,
pleurisy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The buccal mucosa may be dry and cracked, and the tongue
coated. From the first the animal is dull, and prostrate, and the
visible mucosæ become dusky brown or even yellowish from the
liberated hæmatin. Blood abstracted, will show the microörganism,
an excess of leucocytes and diminution of the red globules.
The poison determines hæmolysis. A cardiac murmur, usually
with the first sound, betrays endocarditis. This is especially
characteristic of chronic pyæmia. Again multiple suppurating
arthritis may appear. Stupor, coma or paralysis will indicate
cerebral or meningeal lesions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In pyæmia following trauma there is drying up of the pus
which becomes serous or bloody, a puffy condition of the granulations,
and the evidence of a thrombus in one or more veins leading
out from the wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>In other cases the occurrence of pyæmic symptoms, consequent
on parturition, metritis, omphalitis, bone-abscess or osteomyelitis,
on suppurating internal inflammations, ulcerative endocarditis, or
infective fevers like strangles, influenza, contagious pneumonia,
cattle plague, distemper, rouget, hog cholera, etc., serves to
identify the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>prognosis</i> of pyæmia is always grave, and death may be
expected in six to fourteen days in acute cases. Chronic forms
last much longer.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention</i> is the great object in regard to surgical cases, and
this means the prevention of suppuration in the wound. As far
as possible, however, this is to be sought by asepsis, or the use
of weak non-caustic antiseptics only, as cauterized tissues form
favorable culture media, when the action of the antiseptic is spent,
there being no longer any living and resistant leucocytes present.
The early excision of veins, the seat of thrombosis, has proven
successful.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>In purely medical cases, the seat of the primary suppuration is
not always obvious and one is thrown back on medical treatment
which is rarely satisfactory in severe cases.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> When accessible even the secondary abscesses may
be opened, washed out with a weak antiseptic (3 per cent. carbolic
acid solution), and covered with antiseptic dressing. Antipyretics
are worse than useless, because of the resulting depression
of the vital powers, and the reduction of the natural powers of
resistance. Calomel in small and repeated doses tends to assist in
elimination, and to counteract complications through sepsis of the
contents of the bowels. Quinine and chloride of iron continued
in large doses have been especially relied on as antiseptic tonics.
Liberal feeding, if the appetite will admit, is all important, to tide
the patient over the period of depression. In the chronic cases
tepid bathing is of great value (Senn). Senn has great confidence
in the stimulating and supporting action of alcoholic liquors—beer,
ale, porter and even whisky, and in human beings accustomed
to the daily use of these beverages they are more imperative
than in the lower animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Septicæmia.</b> The micro-organisms causing septicæmia are the
same as those of pyæmia, but they differ somewhat in activity,
and act upon a system with a modified susceptibility, and above
all one void of lesions in the internal membrane of the vascular
system. The symptoms can be developed by the introduction of
the ptomaines and toxins alone, which hypothetical condition has
been named <i>septic-intoxication</i>. In case of excessive doses of
septic material, death occurs so early as to indicate simple narcosis.
If, as is usually the case, the microbes also gain access to the
blood and multiply there, the condition has been known as <i>septic
infection</i>. In any prolonged case of septicæmia, the tendency is
to the formation of suppurating foci (<i>septico-pyæmia</i>), so that
the two affections may be looked upon as probably the same, with
modifications of the earlier phenomena.</p>

<p class='c008'>In connection with septicæmia must be mentioned the <i>fermentation
fever</i> of Bergmann, (<i>aseptic</i> or <i>resorption fever</i>) which
follows on extensive wounds, even if aseptic, on the intravenous
injection of the blood of healthy animals or even of fine foreign
particles (charcoal, flour), of a normal salt solution, or of well
water, or of pancreatin, pepsin or trypsin. It has been attributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>to the introduction and metabolism of fibrine and other elements,
but manifestly arises also from the solution of blood globules,
(hæmolysis). It comes on within a few hours after a severe operation
or other cause and lasts from one to three days, terminating
in recovery, unless complicated by some intercurrent infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>sapræmic fever</i>, of Mathews Duncan (sapros—putrid, haima—blood)
may also be named in this connection. It is associated with
one or more of the common saprophytes (Bacillus saprogenes 1–2
and 3 of Rosenbach, Proteus Vulgaris, Proteus Zenkeri, Proteus
mirable, etc.) These are propagated with difficulty in the blood,
but grow readily in pus or necrotic tissue from which their toxic
products can pass into the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the observations of Brieger and Maas, Ruine, Vaughan,
Bourget and others show that the isolated toxins from putrefactive
fermentation of animal matters, apart from the living bacteria
are capable of producing the characteristic symptoms of
septicæmia.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is now generally concluded that the septicæmic phenomena
can be produced by the introduction of such poisons, whether
they are the product of septic fermentations outside the animal
poisoned, or of fermentation in dead matter in the economy of
such animal.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> In <i>fermentation fever</i> no tissue lesions are known.
In <i>septicæmia</i> gross lesions are usually lacking unless the case has
been prolonged to allow of secondary abscesses (septico-pyæmia).
The blood however is dark and coagulates feebly if at all. The
spleen is enlarged, softened, dark in color and gorged with blood.
There are petechial hæmorrhages into the serosæ and mucosæ,
and the solid organs; cloudy swelling of internal organs from
coagulation necrosis; a parboiled appearance of heart, liver,
kidneys and voluntary muscles; congestion of the lymph glands
and usually the presence of the specific microbes in the blood and
local lesions. The kidneys are always congested, and their epithelia
granular and swollen, and there may be exudation between
the glomeruli and their capsules.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> Septic intoxication or septic infection may be
ushered in by a staring coat or slight chill, but it rarely shows a
violent rigor, such as inaugurates pyæmia. There is a rapid rise
of temperature (102° to 104°), which persists for three to seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>days without the marked remissions of pyæmia; weak, compressible
pulse; great muscular debility; hurried, shallow breathing,
usually without cough; anorexia; emesis in vomiting animals;
dusky or yellow mucosæ from dissolved hæmoglobin; scanty,
high colored urine, rarely albuminous; dulness, sometimes nervous
twitching, delirium, apathy, stupor or paraplegia; and either
constipation or, later, diarrhœa. When such symptoms supervene
on a gangrenous sore, septic abscess or fistula, retained placenta,
blood clot in the uterus or elsewhere, suppurating tubercle,
or other morbid product, gangrenous lung or other internal organ,
purulent pericarditis, pleuritis or peritonitis, or any febrile affection
which is complicated by necrosis, septicæmia is to be suspected.
“Septicæmia should always be suspected during the
course of any disorder the lesions of which afford an opportunity
for the growth and development of septic microörganisms, when
the symptoms of that disorder depart from the usual type and an
elevated temperature continues beyond the usual duration.” (Atkinson).
“The final diagnosis of septic infection must be based
on the existence of an infection atrium, through which pus microbes
have entered the tissues, and from which they have
reached the general circulation.” (Senn).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis</i> is always grave. A slight infection, overcome by the
leucocytes or a simple septic intoxication may get well in two or
three days, but an <i>acute progressive septic infection</i> will usually
prove fatal in from one to seven days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention</i> does not differ from that recommended for pyæmia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> is virtually hopeless unless it can secure the removal
of the necrotic tissue or fermenting material from which the poison
is derived. When the poisoning is due to the absorption of
septic products only, with little or no introduction of microbes
(septic intoxication) the removal of their source of supply may
bring about a speedy and permanent improvement. The removal
of a putrid placenta, or liquid from the womb, followed by irrigation
with an antiseptic lotion, the evacuation of a putrid abscess,
empyema, or ascites, followed by a similar disinfection, or indeed
the extirpation of a sloughing and putrid mass of any kind may
be followed by a lowering of temperature within a few hours, and
a steady improvement in the general symptoms. The antiseptic
agents employed must be sufficiently potent, and persistently applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to render the surface sterile and yet not so caustic as to destroy
more tissue to become a future culture medium for the septic
microbes. Mercuric chloride (1:2000), aluminium acetate
(1:100), powdered iodoform, or aristol will often serve a good
purpose, to be followed, when necessary, by efficient drainage
and a covering of antiseptic gauze. When the primary source of
infection is in the intestinal canal, calomel, naphthalin or B. napthol
may be tried.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the weak heart strychnine is the most safe and reliable
agent. Quinia in large doses acts as an antipyretic, without the
attendant dangers of the coal tar products. It may be advantageously
combined with tincture of chloride of iron.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ammoniacal and alcoholic stimulants are largely resorted to to
tide the patient over the period of depression, and nourishing and
easily digested food should be given so far as the stomach can
make use of it. Skim milk, eggs, and beef tea may be given even
to the herbivorous patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thirst should be met by plenty of pure water to favor elimination
of the toxins, and the surface frequently sponged with tepid
water, not only on the ground of cleanliness and disinfection,
but also as calculated to lower the febrile temperature.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MALIGNANT ŒDEMA.</h3>

<p class='c006'><i>Definition.</i> Causes. Bacillus septicæmiæ gangrenosa, anærobic, rarely
in living blood. Source of germ in soils. Pathogenic to man and domestic
animals except cattle. First attack immunizes. Infects deep wound,
exudates, dropsical and gangrenous parts, womb, intestine, debilitated
parts, large dose intravenously. Lesions and symptoms: excess of exudate,
boggy swelling, watery discharge, fœtid gas bubbles, œdema of lungs and
bowels. Complex infection. Minimum dose—abscess. Diagnosis: from
black quarter and anthrax. Treatment: free incisions, hydrogen peroxide.
Prevention: disinfection of skin and wounds. Immunity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> An acute bacteridian disease of domestic and wild
mammals, and of man, manifested by doughy, painful and often
crepitating swelling in the vicinity of the affected part, and proving
fatal in many cases in twenty-four to forty-eight hours.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cause.</i> The essential cause is the bacillus of malignant œdema,
the septic vibrio of Pasteur, bacillus septicus gangrenæ of Arloing,
the bacillus of septicæmia gangrenosa of others.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><i>Morphology.</i> This is a staff-shaped microbe 3–4 μ. long by 1 μ.
broad, often united in chains of three or more to form long flexuous
filaments. They are furnished with numerous flagella by
which they are rendered very actively motile. The movements
are tardy or simply flexuous in the filaments. Spores form in the
isolated bacilli (not in the filaments) in suitable culture media and
at a temperature of from 20° to 38° C. They occupy a place near
the centre of the bacilli, not the ends as in the bacillus of emphysematous
anthrax. The bacilli are anærobic and die quickly in
air, but the spores are unaffected by oxygen. The spores are similarly
resistant to most disinfectants. They will grow readily in
ordinary culture media if oxygen is excluded, for example under an
atmosphere of hydrogen, nitrogen or carbon dioxide, and liquefy
gelatine. Even the oxygen present in the circulating blood is
highly inimical to them, so that they are rarely found in the blood
during life, but rapidly invade both it and the tissues after death,
and the suspension of respiration. In peptonised and glucosed
gelatine the colonies are characterized as globules of liquefaction
usually combined with gas. The germ is widely distributed in
soils in general and not confined to limited areas like the bacilli of
anthrax and black quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> The bacillus attacks man, horse, ass,
goat, sheep, pig, mouse, Guinea pig, rabbit, white rat, cat, dog,
chicken, pigeon, and duck. The mature ox is immune, but
calves suffer. Dogs are often immune having already suffered
from the disease. A first attack gives immunity from a second.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Infection Channels.</i> Inoculation on an abrasion of the skin or
surface sore is not usually infecting, the oxygen of the air destroying
the germ. If, however, it is inserted deeply in the connective
tissue, subcutem, it grows readily in a susceptible animal.
Hence the danger of infection in deep wounds the recesses of
which are not exposed to the air, and in such it becomes a most
redoubtable surgical complication. If such wounds are the seat
of active inflammation, with abundant exudate and more or less
exclusion of the air-bearing blood, and in cases of blood stasis
the field is specially inviting to the bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'>The debility of the injured tissue is a further invitation to the
attack. Chauveau injected 4 to 5cc. of virulent liquid of malignant
œdema into the veins of a ram and then practised bistournage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>with the result that an invasion of malignant œdema of
the scrotum and tunica vaginalis followed immediately. Pure cultures
may be harmless, whilst an admixture of proteus vulgaris
or micrococcus prodigiosus renders them most deadly (Penzo).
Granulating wounds are even less favorable to invasion than
simple abrasions. In these the bacillus cannot enter at once into
the lymph channels and is exposed to destruction by the combined
influence of the air and leucocytes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wounds in dropsical or gangrenous parts are equally favorable,
to the development of the bacillus. Under such conditions the
tissues are wanting in oxygen and resemble the condition of the
entire body after death, when the bacillus of malignant œdema
quickly penetrates its whole substance. Petri has traced the infection
through the genital passages of newly delivered rabbits,
producing a fatal metro-peritonitis and cutaneous œdema. A
similar invasion may take place in other susceptible parturient
animals. Lustig in a certain number of cases satisfied himself
that he had traced the invasion through the intestine of the living
horse. Invasion by the lungs, even by spores, is usually
rendered impossible by reason of the presence of the inspired air.</p>

<p class='c008'>A large dose of the virus is most likely to effect a successful
invasion, since the toxins tend to debilitate and lower the defensive
powers of the tissues and leucocytes. The effect of the
toxins is shown under injections into the arteries, veins or trachea.
A certain amount of hyperthermia follows, but there is rarely
any colonization and reproduction of the bacillus in the connective
tissue. In dogs and rabbits large doses given in this way induce
short inspiration and broken or double expirations. In fatal
doses death is preceded by extreme dyspnœa and convulsions.
(Rodet and Courmont).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions and Symptoms.</i> The tissues where invasion occurs,
become the seat of an abundant œdematous exudation, which
feels boggy and painful and may even crepitate when pressed or
manipulated. In case of an open wound, there is a profuse
liquid discharge of a yellowish watery or serous aspect, and
bubbles of gas or froth having a somewhat fœtid odor. The
center of the swelling may become soft and flaccid while the
peripheral parts where the disease is advancing are tense and resistant.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>In fatal cases the mucosæ of the small intestine and lungs are
usually the seats of œdema in which the bacillus is found. The
bacilli may also be found in the liver. It is noticeable that gross
lesions of the spleen and kidneys are usually absent, in marked
contrast with anthrax. The microbes found in the tissues may be
in the form of bacilli, micrococci (spores, or m. prodigiosus), and
sometimes filaments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inoculation with a minimum dose usually results in local abscess
only.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> From <i>emphysematous anthrax</i>, with which malignant
œdema is most likely to be confounded, it is to be distinguished
by its appearance anywhere outside the black quarter
areas, by the immunity of cattle which are so obnoxious to emphysematous
anthrax, by the susceptibility of man, who does not
contract black quarter, by the formation of the spore near the
middle of the bacillus in place of at one end, by its resistance to
the action of ordinary disinfectants, and by the greater tendency
to form filaments.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>anthrax</i> it is differentiated by its appearance outside
the anthrax localities, by the absence of the bacillus from the
blood and from the surface layers of the skin, by the normal size
of the spleen, and by the active motility of the bacillus. It cannot
be cultivated like anthrax in the free air or on the surface of
culture media, and unlike anthrax bacillus, its cultures produce
bubbles or gas.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> This is essentially surgical and consists in free incisions
to admit air freely to all parts of the œdematous tissue,
perfect drainage and a liberal use of peroxide of hydrogen. Other
disinfectants may be employed but are much less promising. The
free disinfection of the adjacent skin is an important element in
treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> This consists essentially in the thorough disinfection
of all accidental and surgical wounds, the careful cleansing
and antisepsis of the skin before an operation, the exclusion of
earth, manure, or water from driven wells or fountains, from all
wounds, and above all the exclusion of proteus vulgaris, and
micrococcus prodigiosus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunity</i> may be secured by a first, non-fatal attack of the
disease.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INFECTIOUS FEVERS OF SWINE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One name for several affections. Differentiation, swine erysipelas, hog
cholera and swine plague. Complex infections. Effects of large, medium
and small doses, of more or less potent germ, of greater or less susceptibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until comparatively recent years the various infectious fevers
of swine have been confounded and described as a single disease,
the name varying in the different countries in which they were
observed. In America it was <i>Hog Cholera</i>; in England, <i>Swine
Fever</i>; in France, <i>Rouget</i>; and in Germany, <i>Schweineseuche</i>. A
closer study showed a marked tendency to a particular class of
lesions in different epizoötics, and bacteriological research associated
plagues in given localities with different microbes, so that
progress has been made in differentiating one from another to a
certain extent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first clear distinction was made in setting aside the swine
erysipelas (rouget, rothlauf,) from the rest as distinguished at
once by its small, delicate bacillus, differing notably from the
others in its staining and cultural peculiarities, as well as in the
predominance of the cutaneous lesions.</p>

<p class='c008'>What remains after eliminating erysipelas, constitutes a group
having so much in common that attempts at further differentiation
have led to much disputation, and not even to-day is there such
accord in different countries as the writer of a text-book would
find desirable. One class of pathologists claims but one common
disease with many varieties under different conditions, just as the
term <i>septicæmia</i> or <i>blood poisoning</i> has been made to designate a
whole class of local and general infections, irrespective of the
particular microbes that cause them. Others with greater precision
give the disease a name according to the causation by one
particular microörganism, or by another, which may be closely
related to it in many respects, but which in successive subjects
and outbreaks, maintains its own individual characteristics as regards
morphology, cultural and staining habits, pathogenesis, etc.
The question has been rendered all the more trying, by the occasional
association in the same animal system, or in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>outbreak of two distinct varieties of microörganisms, in place of
one, giving rise of course to modifications in the symptoms, lesions,
progress, mortality, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Apart from the microörganism the whole class tends to show
a close family relationship in their pathological phenomena shown
under different conditions :</p>

<p class='c008'>1st. Under a large dose, or specially virulent germ, in a particularly
susceptible animal, all tend to a manifestation of an
acute septicæmia, with generally diffused petechiæ of the skin,
mucosæ, serosæ and internal organs, blood extravasations, and
an early high mortality.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. Under a smaller dose, or a less potent germ, or in a less
susceptible animal the tendency is to necrotic processes in the
seat of inoculation or the point of election of local lesions. Necrotic
ulcers are especially common in cases that survive one, two
or three weeks, or that develop in a subacute or chronic form.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d. With a minimum dose of a germ of little potency, and in a
very resistant subject even the necrotic lesions may be absent,
and there may be suppuration only or ulceration of serosæ and
joints.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question of the primary identity, or disparity of the whole
class of germs, causing the septicæmic swine plagues, may be
practically ignored in this work; it is important rather with our
present knowledge to note the diseases associated with particular
germs, or varieties of germs, and to describe these as far as possible
as independent affections. This is as permissible as it is to
describe smallpox, sheeppox, and cowpox as distinct affections,
no matter what may be the truth or falsity as to their alleged original
identity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Rouget</i> in Europe and <i>Hog Cholera</i> and <i>Swine Plague</i>, as the
best established types in the United States deserve primary mention,
to be followed by references to additional types which have
been found to be associated with other distinct microörganisms.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ROUGET, ROTHLAUF. RED FEVER OF SWINE. SWINE ERYSIPELAS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Definition. Comparative immunity of sucking pigs. Disease unknown
in America. Causes: Bacillus erysipelatos suis, mature age, infection
through yards, buildings, troughs, dust, mice, rabbits, pigeons, men, dogs,
vermin, birds, butcher’s and kitchen scraps, swill, hot weather, damp seasons,
close pens, movement of swine, stockyards, fairs, public conveyances,
public highways. Symptoms: incubation three days, chill, violet mucosæ,
hyperthermia, recumbency under litter, muscular weakness especially behind,
inappetence, thirst, costiveness, later diarrhœa, tenderness to touch, lymph
glands swollen, red, blue, violet or black discoloration of skin, cutaneous
swelling and pitting. Course: death in 12 hours to 6 days, or convalescence
prompt. Mortality 20 to 80 per cent. Lesions: congestion of capillary
vessel, blood extravasations, petechiæ, affecting cutis and subcutaneous
fat, lymph glands congested, discolored; lungs engorged; spleen enlarged,
liver and kidneys congested, petechiæ general, blood little altered. Bacillus
1.5 μ, anærobic, easily destroyed in pens, in pork. Pathogenesis: swine,
rabbits, mice, rats, pigeons and sparrows suffer. Rabbit germ less fatal to
pigs. Immunization, advantages and drawbacks. Technique.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> A microbian disease of swine manifested by high
fever, great prostration and muscular weakness, a violet tint of
the visible mucosæ, red or violet discoloration of the skin in spots
and patches or universally, enlarged lymph glands, encreased size
of the spleen, and general congestion of the capillary plexus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Contrary to the habit of hog cholera and swine plague, rouget
attacks mature swine mainly, the sucking pig showing a remarkable
power of resistance. It does not appear whether this is due
to the animal (milk) diet or to the absence of infection from feeding
in the trough used by the adult animals. Up to the present
this disease has not been recognized in America.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The one essential cause of rouget is the presence of the
bacillus. The other conditions are either such as predispose the
animal to receive it, for example, mature age: or they are such
as favor diffusion of the poison, such as the introduction of an infected
animal, the feeding of the healthy from the same manger
with the infected, the introduction into the manger of the feet or
snout which have become soiled with the infected manure or
urine, the distribution of the infection in dust, the introduction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the bacillus in the bodies of mice, rabbits, or pigeons, or on the
feet of those animals, of men, dogs, birds, and vermin. We may
add the distribution of infection in dried butcher’s scraps used
in pig feeding, and in uncooked scraps from the kitchen or in
hotel swill.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been noted that the highest mortality prevails in hot
summer weather, in damp seasons, and in narrow, confined,
badly ventilated pens. Under such circumstances the introduction
of a diseased pig will lead to the infection of most of the
others in a few hours. Infection is quite as prompt through
public pens in stock yards and fairs, and in public conveyances
(cars, stock wagons, steamboats, ferry boats, etc.) and public
highways.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> After a period of incubation of three days or more
the subject is seized with shivering, the limbs are hot and cold
alternately, respiration and heart beats are accelerated, the mucous
membranes assume a dark violet tint and the rectal temperature
rises to 104° to 108° F. From the first the pig tends to bury
itself under the litter, and refuses to move unless absolutely forced
to do so, and then only with painful grunts, swaying and staggering
limbs (especially the hind ones), and straight drooping tail.
There is inappetence, but thirst remains, and the bowels are at
first costive, the manure being covered with a film of mucous or
even streaks of blood; later they become relaxed and diarrhœa
becomes often a prominent symptom. The pig seems to suffer
and often squeals when handled, and he may give a weak, dry
cough. The external inguinal glands may often be felt perceptibly
enlarged. The red discoloration of the skin appears early
and extends and deepens to the end in fatal cases. It may be of
a bright red, or of a bluish red, violet or black. The first indications
appear as spots, by preference around the roots of the ears,
on the breast and abdomen, inside the arms and thighs, and in
the perineum. These isolated spots run together into great
patches, which extend over the whole ventral aspect of the body,
and may cover the entire dorsal aspect as well. In some instances
the skin is swollen and retains an impression made by the finger.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Course.</i> The disease may reach a fatal termination in twelve
hours: more commonly it endures for forty-eight hours, and at
times it will last for four, five or six days. In the most rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>fatal cases, the violet discoloration of the skin may be absent or
only a little marked, while in the protracted cases it acquires its
greatest extensions and its darkest shades. In the protracted
cases too the prostration becomes extreme, the animal may find
it impossible to raise himself on his hind limbs, the diarrhœa becomes
profuse, liquid and fœtid, the respiration labored, cyanosis
sets in and the temperature is reduced below the normal standard.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of recovery, convalescence is usually prompt and complete,
differing in this from cases of swine plague and hog cholera.
The more favorable issue in rouget probably depends on the comparative
integrity of the intestinal mucosa and mesenteric glands,
which are subject to slow healing lesions in swine plague and hog
cholera. Slow convalescence is however not uncommon, yet in
such cases, the concurrent, speedy and complete recoveries in other
animals in the same herd serve to identify the disease as rouget.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality.</i> The mortality among grown hogs averages eighty
per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Morbid Anatomy.</i> The most prominent lesion is the general
congestion of the capillary blood vessels, and the numerous minute
extravasations or petechiæ. The skin shows in the red patches
a general dilatation of the capillaries which have become at the
same time elongated and tortuous, with minute, often microscopic,
ruptures and extravasations at frequent intervals. This usually
extends to the whole thickness of the cutis, and to a considerable
depth in the subcutaneous fat. Where swelling occurred or pitting
on pressure, a serous infiltration of the tissues is found.
The lymph glands are uniformly enlarged and discolored, of a
dark red, almost black, color, the congestion and extravasation
being extreme in the cortical substance, while the medullary is
paler, soft and cellular. The lungs are usually gorged with black
blood suggesting death by asphyxia. In tardy cases there may,
though rarely, be centres of broncho-pneumonia. The spleen is
enlarged, with dark color and uneven surface from rounded
swellings, and is filled by a soft black, bloody pulp. The liver
is congested, the kidneys congested, enlarged and petechiated,
and the gastric and intestinal mucosa congested and thickened,
with desquamating epithelium, and swollen solitary and agminated
glands, the degree of alteration usually bearing a ratio to the
duration of the disease. The serosæ are usually extensively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>petechiated and serous effusions occur into the serous cavities.
The muscular substance of the heart and the endocardium are also
the seats of petechial extravasations. Unless in some protracted
cases the blood appears to be unaltered as regards its power of
taking up oxygen, or coagulating.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacillus of Rouget.</i> The germ of this disease is found in
small numbers only, in the blood and vascular tissues, but very
abundantly in the lymph glands, the spleen, the kidneys, and
the red marrow of the bone. It is also present in enormous
quantities in the urine and the bowel dejections, the former
(urine) offering a ready means of diagnosing the disease microscopically.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacillus is 1µ to 1.5µ long by 0.1µ to 0.15µ broad, is nonmotile,
and stains readily even in Gram’s solution. They occur
either solitary or in pairs tending to unite at an angle. In old
artificial cultures chains of considerable length may be formed.
In the blood the bacillus is usually found in the leucocytes, as
many as 20 or more being often present in a single cell. In the
lymph networks of organs they also invade the leucocytes but
are found in free masses as well. The bacillus is anærobic, but
facultative ærobic, its preference being manifestly for the absence
of oxygen. It is non-liquefying. In gelatine cultures no development
takes place on the surface, but along the line of puncture
a delicate cloud-like branching growth takes place which extends
horizontally in parallel masses from the central puncture. This
resembles but is not quite so delicate as that formed by the bacillus
of mouse septicæmia with which it is supposed to be identical.
It grows scantily on the surface of nutrient agar or blood serum,
but not at all on bouillon, in the bottom of which, however, it
forms a slight grayish white deposit. It does not grow on potato.
The bacillus sometimes shows refrangent granules which have
been supposed to be spores, but this idea appears to be negatived
by the ease with which its vitality is destroyed by heat and disinfectants.
The thermal death point is 68° C. (137° F.) maintained
for 10 minutes (Sternberg). Boulton found that it was killed in 2
hours by mercuric chloride (1:10000), by carbolic acid solution
(1:100), and by sulphate of copper solution (1:100).</p>

<p class='c008'>It is killed by desiccation, by quick lime and by chloride of
lime. At a temperature of 18° to 27° F. it perished in 13 days.
In salted pork it lost vitality in one month.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><i>Pathogenesis.</i> The bacillus is pathogenic to swine, rabbits,
white mice, house mice, white rats, pigeons and sparrows. Field
mice, guinea pigs and chickens are immune.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mice and pigeons take the disease most certainly, and die in
three days to five, the whole body swarming with bacilli. Rabbits
take the disease less certainly or rapidly, inoculation in the
ear causing first an erysipelatoid inflammation and recovery with
immunity often takes place.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization.</i> When inoculated continuously from rabbit to
rabbit it encreases its potency for that animal, which it comes to
kill in 24 to 48 hours, but in the same ratio it loses its virulence
for swine upon which it can then be inoculated without danger to
their life.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was on this basis that Pasteur and Thuillier established in
1883, their preventive inoculation for rouget. The method has
been most extensively employed in Europe, and where intelligently
employed has prevented this disease. From the laboratory
at Buda-Pest alone, there was sent out in one year material
for 249,816 swine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The objections to the method are: the danger of mistaking
hog cholera and swine plague respectively for rouget, as the
rouget mitigated germ would be in no sense protective against
these; and the danger of spreading the germs of rouget in fresh
localities and thus introducing a new plague instead of controlling
and preventing an old one. In the Baden experiments 5.4 per
cent. of inoculated pigs died, and of 118 unprotected pigs exposed
to them 62 per cent. contracted the disease and one died. In
France and Hungary, on the other hand, 1 to 1.45 per cent. died
of the operation, instead of 20 per cent. when the disease was
contracted in the ordinary way.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is held that the danger lies largely in the inoculation of very
young pigs, and Nocard advises to operate only on those of four
months and upward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The danger of spreading the germ by inoculation may be the more
easily guarded against, considering that it is very destructible by
disinfectant agents (heat, dryness, cold, chloride of lime, quick
lime), and that it does not readily survive in a locality, where it
cannot find a constant succession of victims. Yet the practice
ought to be confined to herds exposed to infection, and under
special precautions, as regards the exposure of other herds.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The <i>technique</i> of the Pasteurian inoculation is to inject, subcutem,
on the inside of the thigh, 0.1cc. of the weaker preparation
(premier vaccin), and twelve days after a similar dose of the
stronger one (deuxieme vaccin).</p>

<p class='c008'>This produces a mild attack of the disease from which the great
majority recover, and though they still react somewhat to a second
and third inoculation yet the disease so produced is rarely
fatal.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> A contagious bacteridian disease of swine, acute
or subacute, and characterized by hyperthermia and other febrile
disorders,—congestion, exudation, ecchymosis and necrotic ulceration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>of the intestinal mucosa and of that of the stomach and of
other parts,—by a profuse foul, liquid diarrhœa, by enlargement
of the lymph glands with congestion and blood extravasation,—by
effaceable blotches, and petechiæ (ineffaceable) of the skin,
snout and visible mucosæ, with a tendency to necrotic changes—less
frequently by pulmonary congestions, and degeneration,—and
by a high mortality.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Synonyms.</i> The earlier designations were mostly drawn from
the red or black discoloration of the skin and mucosæ and applied
indiscriminately to the other forms of hæmorrhagic septicæmia
which we now differentiate as erysipelas (rouget, Rothlauf)
and swine plague. They included <i>measles</i>, <i>erysipelas</i>,
<i>scarlatina</i>, <i>red soldier</i>, <i>purples</i>, <i>blue sickness</i>, <i>carbuncular fever</i>, etc.
Others basing their nomenclature on the prominent intestinal
lesions, etc., designated it <i>typhoid fever</i>, <i>pig typhoid</i>, <i>typhus</i>, <i>carbuncular
gastro-enteritis</i>, <i>pneumo-enteritis</i>, and <i>diphtheria</i>. Even
in Europe while the <i>pig erysipelas</i> (<i>rouget</i>, <i>Rothlauf</i>) is now
recognized as a distinct disease there is no clear distinction made
between <i>hog cholera</i> and <i>swine plague</i>. In England we find these
more or less confounded under the names of <i>swine fever</i>, <i>swine
plague</i> and <i>hog cholera</i>, and on the continent of Europe under
those of <i>schweineseuche</i> and <i>schweinepest</i>, or <i>pneumo-enteritis infectieuses</i>.
Differences in different epizoötics or outbreaks are
recognized, and the field is left open for the future identification
of different forms of this common group of swine fevers, but the
existence of constant bacteriological distinctions are not always
insisted on, as we do in the United States in the case of the two
great leading types <i>swine plague</i> and <i>hog cholera</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History.</i> Definite history of this disease may be said to begin
with the discovery and demonstration of the actively motile hog
cholera bacillus by the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry in 1885.
Yet in the history of animal plagues, even in early times, deadly
epizoötics are described which undoubtedly represented one or
other of the contagious affections of modern times. Among the
more definite may be named a destructive gastro-enteritis (magen
seuche) in Germany in 1817, a pleuro-pneumonia in France and
Bavaria in 1821, a cholera with blotching of the skin (morbus
niger) in Ireland, and an erysipelas in pigs in France and
Switzerland in 1836, and in Ohio in 1833, there was a fatal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>affection afterward recognized as hog cholera. Writers conjecture
that it was imported into America from Europe in improved
pigs, and from one European country to another in the
same way, but we have no absolute proof of times and shipments
and their immediate effects, so that these theories are but more or
less reasonable deductions from the familiar extensions of the
disease in more recent cases. Under the great commercial activity
of the latter half of the 19th century, the active movements of
animals by canal, steamboat and rail, and the massing together
in one market of many animals drawn from widely different
sources, hog cholera has made extraordinary extensions on both
sides of the Atlantic, until Friedberger and Fröhner pronounce
the schweineseuche and schweinepest the most widely disseminated
and dangerous of swine epizoötics, and Dr. Salmon estimates the
losses in the United States at $10,000,000 to $25,000,000, per
annum.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> Prior to 1885 bacteria had been found in the
different outbreaks of contagious fevers in swine, and the bacillus
of swine erysipelas had been demonstrated in 1882, but it was
only two years later (1884) that the motile bacillus choleræ suis
was first described by Klein, and in 1885 that Salmon and Smith
demonstrated it as the essential cause of the disease, together
with its biological and cultural peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a short bacillus, 1.2 to 2μ × 0.5 to 0.8μ, but varying considerably
in size according to the stage of its growth and the
genera of animal or culture medium in which it is grown. It has
rounded ends and is usually in pairs connected by an invisible
band. It stains promptly in all the aqueous aniline colors, but
loses the stain in a solution of iodine (Gram’s). Prolonged exposure
of artificial cultures produces an uniform stain, while a
transient exposure, and especially of bacilli obtained from the
tissues, stains them most deeply at the ends (polar) and periphery,
while the centre remains somewhat clear. This is less marked
than in the bacillus of swine plague, yet serves to show the relation
between this microbe and the colon group.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is <i>ærobic</i> (facultative anærobic), non-liquefying, and, in
fluids, very actively motile, the movements lasting for months in
preserved specimens (Smith). It grows luxuriantly in various
culture media, and especially in alkaline ones, at the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>temperature, and most actively at 85° to 100° F. It may grow
as low as 60° to 70° F. and as high as 104°. (Swine plague
bacillus grows at 55.4°).</p>

<p class='c008'>On <i>peptonized gelatine</i> the surface colonies are usually round
and flattened, those in its substance globular and smaller, and
those at the bottom expanded next the glass and rising in the
center into the gelatine like a knob. At 48 hours they appear as
opaque whitish points and slowly increase to ½ to 2 mm. They
may be brown by transmitted light, the depth of color increasing
with age. On <i>agar</i> the colonies are grayish, shining and translucent
and may reach the size of 4 to 6 mm. On <i>potato</i> (alkaline)
a straw yellow film is formed, darkening with growth. In <i>bouillon</i>
a turbidity appears in 24 hours, and in 1 or 2 weeks a precipitate
and surface film.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacillus is usually larger in the gelatine and smaller in the
bouillon than it is in the tissues. It seems to produce neither
phenol nor indol.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its behavior with sugars is significant. It ferments glucose
producing acid and gas; does not ferment saccharose nor lactose,
but turns the saccharose solution alkaline (no gas). In bouillon
containing muscle glucose, it may without additional glucose
form a little gas. The swine plague bacillus ferments saccharose
producing acids but no gas: it ferments neither glucose nor lactose
but turns the former acid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Milk is neither coagulated nor soured by the hog cholera
bacillus, but in 3 to 4 weeks it undergoes a change, becoming
saponified.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cultures have no special nor offensive odor. Some varieties
in close tubes may cause a faint acid odor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oxygen is not essential to the success of a culture. The colonies
form as promptly and as large in the depths of gelatine, or in a
vacuum, as if in free air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following table will serve to show differences between the
hog cholera bacilli, and related pathogenic microbes:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> These are especially those conditions which
favor the transmission of the germ from animal to animal. They
include the reprehensible habit of allowing swine to run at large
so that herd mingles with herd; the freedom to wander along
the lines of railroad by which hogs are carried, and where the
infected excretions fall on the ground; the scattering of infected
litter or manure from a car or boat; the use of the same cars,
boats or trucks for the conveyance of infected and sound pigs in
succession, without intermediate disinfection; the use of the
same loading banks, chutes, runways, yards, pens and feeding
and watering troughs by strange pigs from all sources in succession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>without constant disinfection; the purchase of stock swine
at public markets; the return of swine from public fairs and
exhibitions; the feeding and watering of pigs on the line of
streams that have drained pig pens or pastures higher up; the
use for pigs of premises that have harbored infected ones at an
earlier (even distant) date; the supply of food or litter from
barns where pigs have recently died; the admission to the pens
or yards of butchers, dealers or others who are likely to carry
infection on their persons; the admission even of wagons, dogs
or other animals, including birds, tame and wild, which are liable
to carry infection. Of all birds the buzzard is the most to be
shunned as having presumably just come from infected carrion,
but barnyard fowl and small birds that feed from the same trough
with the pig are to be feared as well. The same remark applies
to rats and mice, squirrels, skunks, woodchucks and rabbits
which may easily carry the infection on their paws. If the infection
is near, flies and other insects, in the warm season, will convey
it for some distance from herd to herd. A common cause is
the feeding of swine about abattoirs where they devour the offal
and waste in a raw condition. Another is the feeding of boarding
house, hotel or other kitchen slops, raw, or without the most
exhaustive precautions in the way of cooking. Many outbreaks
can be traced in this way to the consumption by the animals of the
products of infected swine. Some indeed are fostered by the
utter neglect of the parties in charge of an infected herd, in leaving
the infected carcasses exposed so that they are eaten by
wandering hogs, or portions are carried away by buzzards, carrion
crows, dogs and other animals. In some cases a strong wind
will carry the infection on dust, straw or other light object into
sound herds at a distance. The introduction into a hitherto
healthy herd of an apparently sound pig may be the occasion of
a deadly outbreak. The strange new pig may have already had
the disease, and in a condition of immunity, may without hurt to
itself, carry the germ which becomes so fatal to the susceptible.</p>

<p class='c008'>This susceptibility is one of the most important factors. It
may be inherent in a given family or strain of blood. It may be
enhanced by a constitutional weakness, engendered by too close
breeding, by breeding from the young and immature, or from the
old and worn out. It may be favored by a general debility from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>starvation, faulty or injudicious feeding, as exclusive feeding on
corn (maize), an unbalanced ration, feeding cotton seed, irregular
feeding, etc. It may result from parasitism, as round worms
in the lungs, bowels, muscles, fat, kidneys or liver, from trichinosis,
from cysticerci, echinococci, or from distomatosis. These
not only lessen the force of constitutional and phagocytic resistance,
but they also in many cases open the way for the entrance
of the microbe by the wounds which they inflict. Perhaps nothing
operates more effectively in this way than the attacks of other
pathogenic microbes. The treatment of the domestic hog is often
such that it would almost appear as if it were designed to destroy
health and vitality. He is used to clear up the soiled and spoiled
provender which has been rejected by other animals. Decayed
vegetables and flesh of all kinds, which is no longer fit for other
use, is supposed to be good for him and is furnished raw. Worse
still, this is conveyed in barrels that are never washed, but are
sent for each new supply reeking with abominations which render
them a nuisance on the highway. It is left standing till wanted
in these barrels, or in still larger receptacles, which are never
emptied nor cleaned, but are allowed in the hottest weather, to
continue a hotbed of the foulest fermentations. On a smaller
scale the kitchen swill barrel becomes a similar centre of decomposition.
Even at the creamery and cheese factory the surplus
or waste products often remain in a common tank breeding larvæ,
toxins and ptomaines, before they are fed to the hogs. In the
hog pen, or yard, corn in the ear is thrown on the ground, already
filthy with the solid and liquid excretions and is eaten with the
rotting, if not infecting, filth in which it has been rolled. From
grubbing in this filth with his snout, the pig plunges the latter in
the liquid food in his trough and too often he gets his feet into
the food as well, and further charges it with the injurious ferments.
Again the kitchen swill is liable to contain various inorganic
poisons and notably the carbonates and bicarbonates of
potash and soda which are used to excess in the form of <i>powdered
soaps</i> and, as shown by experiment, are deadly poisons to pigs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gastro-intestinal disorders caused by these poisons; (it
may be botulism from stale or decomposing flesh, fish or fowl, the
poisoning by mouldy bread or musty grain, or meal, or by the
toxins of the many and varied saprophytic fermentations), often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>prove as deadly as outbreaks of genuine hog cholera, and are
habitually mistaken for them. They do not, however, as a rule
extend beyond the particular herd which has been exposed to the
faulty management, and introduce no risk of a general spreading
infection. The careless owner suffers and adjacent herds escape,
unless exposed to similar causes. But if the hog cholera germ is
present these pave the way for its destructive advance and tend to
enhance the mortality. It may even be that the combination of
the two factors is a condition of the eruption of a severe attack.
The faulty feeding or food or poison by itself could be resisted,
and the comparatively non-virulent hog cholera bacillus might
have been resisted, but with the weakened system and digestive
apparatus, the microbe finds a specially inviting field in which it
can multiply destructively, and where it can gather a virulence
which will enable it to invade and sweep away herd after herd in
a deadly epizoötic.</p>

<p class='c008'>I may add, as a prominent factor in the great modern extensions
of hog cholera, the habitual aggregation of swine in large
herds. This with the rapid steam transit of modern times, and
the great aggregations of hogs in one common market, probably
contributes more than anything else to the extraordinary diffusion
of the infection. By accident, purchase or otherwise, a large
herd becomes infected, and the owner, knowing that delay is
ruin, at once ships the apparently healthy animals to market;
these infect anything they or their excretions come in contact
with; if sold in smaller lots they carry infection into every
locality where they go, and along the route; if sold for slaughter,
they still diffuse infection through the herds that receive their
butcher and kitchen trimmings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally other domestic animals may bring in an infection which
becomes manifested by symptoms similar to those of hog cholera,
and which if really different, yet serves to pave the way for such
an outbreak. Galtier’s remarkable experience with a <i>pneumo-enteritis</i>
in sheep, introduced into five separate flocks by infected
pigs from the same market, is significant in this respect. It is
further significant that the hog cholera bacillus is a very protean
microbe. Th. Smith, to whom we owe more than to any one
else the identification of the germ, gives seven varieties, which
showed well-marked distinctions in their morphology, in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>modes of growth on culture media, in the amount of gas they
respectively produced in a glucose bouillon, or in their pathogenesis
for rabbits. One of these modified germs which has
largely parted with its virulence for pigs and some other animals,
may under specially favorable conditions, resume its former potency
and proceed on a new career of infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions in the Acute or Septicæmic Form.</i> The skin and subcutaneous
fat are the seats of diffuse blotches or spots of a deep red
varying from dark purple to light red, confined it may be to the
inner sides of the arms and thighs the belly, the ears, eyelids, and
muzzle, or it may be all but uniformly diffused over the body.
When pressed so as to expel the blood, the greater part of the
surface may be momentarily whitened, but red points remain
representing the minute extravasations. Under the microscope
the red points show tortuous and enlarged capillaries with here
and there a rupture and minute clot. The visible mucosæ may
show similar petechiæ, as may also the serosæ of the chest, cranium
and abdomen. In the latter blood extravasations are liable
to be more extensive. The spleen and lymph glands (particularly
those of the bowels and omentum, the sublumbar and subdorsal
regions) are usually enlarged, gorged with blood and
softened. Many of the lymph glands may escape, and in others
the congestion is largely confined to the cortical portion. The
lungs may show petechiæ and even extensive hæmorrhages into
their substance. The kidneys may show petechiæ in the glomeruli,
the medullary substance, the papillæ or the pelvic mucosa,
or there may be larger circumscribed hæmorrhages.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stomach in its greater curvature especially is usually
deeply congested and petechiated, with small submucous extravasations,
and these conditions are liable to be still more marked in
the small intestines and especially in the large, which may have a
dark red or port wine hue. Blood may be present in clots among
the contents. Necrotic ulcers are absent.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions in the Protracted and Chronic Forms.</i> The lesions of
the skin are usually less extensive than in the acute type, and
may be almost entirely absent. The lymph glands are enlarged
and congested, though the discoloration may be largely confined
to the cortical layer. The spleen is as a rule normal in size. The
liver is firm, but it may show softening of the secreting acini and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>encrease of the fibrous framework. Petechiæ or circumscribed
hæmorrhages may or may not be present on or under the serosæ
or in the tissues.</p>

<p class='c008'>The characteristic lesions belong to the gastric-intestinal organs.
Congestions and ulcers may be found on the gastric mucosa, on
that of the small intestine, and rectum, but they are above all common
on the ileocæcal valve, cæcum and first half of the colon. In
the earlier stages of these lesions the mucosa and submucosa are the
seat of a congestion and exudation, but later the round button-like
ulcer usually stands out prominently with its necrotic centre
dirty white, brown or black, and composed of superposed layers,
the whole resting on a congested and thickened submucosa.
This contains small round and giant cells and may show considerable
encrease in connective tissue. The ulcers may be seated on
the agminated or solitary glands but do not show the same predilection
for these parts which is seen in typhoid fever.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> This varies according to the dose and susceptibility
from two or three to as many as thirty days. With the
short incubation the disease tends to assume its most acute and
deadly type, while the prolonged incubation bespeaks a milder
form. During ordinary outbreaks from six to fourteen days
represent the average interval between exposure and the onset of
active symptoms. During the extreme heats of summer and the
excessive cold of midwinter in our northern states incubation
tends to be shortened.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Fulminant Type.</i> In violent outbreaks some pigs
are found dead without observed preliminary symptoms, and have
been set down as fulminant examples of the disease. When these
occur during very hot weather, in open yards or fields, there is
reason to believe that insolation, acting on a system rendered
specially susceptible by the toxic fever, has much to do with the
early death. Though seldom observed during life, it has been
said that such cases, show extreme dulness, prostration, stupor,
weakness, unsteady gait, thirst, hyperthermia, persistent recumbency,
and at times red blotching of the skin and even convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Acute Type.</i> In contrast with erysipelas these may
advance slowly and insidiously, there is a lack of the customary life
and vivacity, the tail droops, appetite is impaired, the pig creeps
under the litter and lies there, preferably on its belly, a great part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of its time, there may even be tremors suggestive of slight chill,
when moved it shows weakness, may stagger, or it may have
difficulty in rising on its hind limbs and there is encreased thirst
and heat of the skin. Even in the absence of shivering or chill,
the skin is usually tender to the touch, calling out plaintive grunting
or squealing, and the same is often true of manipulation of the
belly. The temperature is raised, yet this must be compared
with the previous temperature under the conditions in which the
pig has been kept. That may have been anywhere from 100° F.
in a confined, cold, draughty pen, to 104° F. in a warm, dry pen
and with plenty of exercise. In hog cholera it may rise 1° to 3°.
The patient is breathless under exertion, the circulation is accelerated
and the mucosæ congested.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sooner or later, (usually by the second or third day) the skin
shows an erythematous blush, especially on the ears, breast, belly
and inner sides of the thighs and forearms, in greater part effaceable
by pressure but promptly reappearing and complicated by darker
spots of extravasation which retain their color under pressure.
The blush may appear in spots of ⅒ to ⅓ inch in diameter, or it
may cover the region, or indeed the whole body uniformly. At
first of a brighter red it tends to pass in succession through the
different shades of purple and violet. Appetite becomes more and
more impaired, and in exceptional cases vomiting may occur, but
often the pig will drink liquid food to the last. A marked symptom
is the enlargement of the inguinal lymph glands, which may
even be tender. An early symptom is watering of the eyes, and
later a muco-purulent exudate may form, and drying, gum the
lids together. An abundant exudate appears on the skin as
the disease advances, most abundantly about the eyelids, roots of
the ears, axillæ and groins, but often covering the whole body,
forming a foul greasy inunction, and later a black scaly covering.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bowels may be costive at first, with fæces, firm, moulded,
and covered with mucous, and this may continue to the end. In
most cases, however, about the second or third day they become
soft, pultaceous and finally liquid, profuse, fœtid, and mixed with
abundance of mucous or even blood. The color varies, they may
be whitish, yellowish (on maize diet), red, or black (on swill).</p>

<p class='c008'>Petechiæ usually form on the mucosæ and small sloughs and
ulcers may be found on the lips, tongue or elsewhere on the buccal
mucosa.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>A cough may be present but is by no means a marked symptom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Emaciation advances with great rapidity, the patient arches the
back, tucks up the abdomen, moves weakly and unsteadily or is
unable to rise, and dies in one or several weeks, it may be quietly
or in a state of coma, but usually without convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Subacute and Chronic Forms.</i> In this type the
disease may be obscure, and even overlooked, so that infected
animals carry the microörganism into fresh herds, without rousing
a suspicion as to its true source. In other cases, after a slow and
progressive development, it takes on such a distinct pathognomonic
character that its diagnosis becomes more easy.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the slightest cases there may be only a capricious or irregular
appetite, drooping tail, enlarged inguinal glands, and a progressive
emaciation, with loss of life and strength and occasional
irregularity of the bowels. The greasy exudation on the skin
and black scaly encrustation is not uncommon. Such patients
usually survive but they are liable to prove unthrifty and unprofitable.</p>

<p class='c008'>In other cases the pig becomes dull and listless, leaves its fellows,
creeps and lies much under the litter, has impaired or
irregular appetite, some costiveness followed by a fœtid diarrhœa,
abdominal tenderness, enlarged inguinal glands, progressive emaciation,
arched loins, hollow flanks, skin exudation, and oftentimes
in the end erythematous eruption with petechiæ and black
scaly exudate on the skin. It is in these protracted cases especially
that the formation and detachment of the necrotic intestinal
sloughs take place and these may pass in the fæces as flattened
rounded masses or more extensive plaques. Necrotic ulcers are
also liable to show on the buccal mucous membrane or skin. The
patient may finally die of colliquative diarrhœa, of exhaustion
and marasmus, in a state of coma as in the more acute cases.
The mortality may be high and the survivors are liable to prove
unthrifty and unprofitable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> With a group of plagues in swine bearing a strong
family resemblance, and maintained by microörganisms, which,
though maintaining distinct characters, yet show so much in
common that it seems not impossible that they may have been
originally derived from a common ancestor, and in face of the
not infrequent complication of two of these microbes in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>patient, it becomes a task of great difficulty to diagnose at once
the particular outbreak that is met with in the field. In some outbreaks,
however, the differential features are clear enough to
allow the veterinarian to pronounce at once on the true nature
of the disease. In others he must withhold his diagnosis until
he can put it to the test of microscopic examination, bacteriological
culture, the Widal test, or inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Hog Cholera</i> may be decided upon, when upon wholesome food,
in healthy environment, without any change of food, and in six
to fourteen days after the introduction of pigs from outside, or
the arrival of strange pigs in the near vicinity, or higher up on
the watershed, sickness appears tardily, taking one or two daily,
with or without a sudden hyperthermia, petechiæ on nose, eyes,
belly, axilla, or groin, a general soreness of the skin and abdomen,
stiffness or weakness, hiding much under the litter, enlargement
of the lymph glands, costiveness with dark red rectum and
glazed dung, followed by a profuse, watery, fœtid, bloody, black
or yellow diarrhœa, and death mostly after one or two weeks or
more. The absence of cough, and the presence of ulcers bearing
necrotic sloughs on the lips, mouth or skin, and above all the
presence of the button-like necrotic ulcers on the mucosæ of the
cæcum, colon or ileum may be accepted as conclusive evidence on
this point. So also its prompt fatality to rodents, but not to
pigeons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swine erysipelas has a much shorter incubation, more rapid
and violent onset, deeper, darker congestion of visible mucosæ,
more extensive petechiæ of skin, mucosæ, serosæ, and tissues generally,
a comparative absence of inflammatory and necrotic lesions
of bowels, a very early and high mortality in swine, rabbits and
pigeons, and a harmlessness toward the inoculated Guinea pig.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Swine plague</i> also shows a shorter incubation, a speedy elevation
of temperature, more mucous congestion, less indication of
abdominal tenderness or of diarrhœa, more cough, dyspnœa,
wheezing and objective symptoms of pulmonary consolidation,
less congestion or engorgement of the spleen, or ulceration of
the bowels, and finally is very much more fatal to pigeons, and
spares neither rabbits nor Guinea pigs.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Widal test.</i> The cessation of movements and the agglutination of
the bacilli of hog cholera, noted by Dawson, is a valuable test,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>but as in the case of typhoid fever in man is not to be implicitly
relied on in all cases. Some of the forms of bacillus coli commune
and other allied microbes act in a similar way. It necessitates
the maintenance of fresh (24 hours) active, artificial, agar
cultures of the hog cholera bacillus and is thus virtually reserved
for the bacteriological laboratory. A drop of blood is drawn
from the suspected pig smeared very thinly on the cover glass and
about 10 times the amount of sterile water added. Then the
smallest possible addition of the agar culture of the bacillus is
made. Immediately, or in ½ hour the bacilli cease their active
motility and mass together in clumps in which they can be seen
individually clear and distinct but absolutely still and crossing
each other in all directions forming a kind of network. A few
isolated bacilli remaining in the intervals between the clumps and
even showing a slight motility are not to be considered as invalidating
the reaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The table on the next page will serve to place in contrast the differential
phenomena of the diseases caused by bacilli of hog cholera,
swine plague and swine erysipelas in uncomplicated infections.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> As in all other contagious diseases, effective preventive
measures imply the destruction of the pathogenic germ
and all sanitary measures should aim at the early and final extinction
of this organism and its subsequent exclusion from the
country. This, however, entails an outlay and governmental
control which it seems idle to expect in the very near future so
that palliative measures, and those looking toward success over
limited areas must still be resorted to. It should be here distinctly
stated, however, that the extinction of a plague, though
often the most expensive at the start, is in the end by far the
most economical resort.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Removal of accessory causes.</i> The <i>health</i> and <i>vigor</i> of the animal
exposed is not without its influence in case of attempted invasion
by a virus of diminished potency.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span><i>Dry, warm beds</i> with plenty of <i>air</i> and <i>light</i> are essential to
vigorous health and the usual damp, filthy, dark pens are depressors
of the vital forces and virtually invitations to hog cholera
as to other diseases. The close packing of swine under manure
or under rotten piles of straw where they often suffocate each
other is to be carefully guarded against. It is a sufficient commentary
on this to say that for every kilogramme of its body
weight, the horse consumes daily 13,272 grammes oxygen, the
cow, 11,040 grammes, and the pig, 29,698 grammes. This is in
perfect keeping with the high normal temperature maintained by
the latter animal. In the interest of health the pig requires twice
the breathing space for every 100 lbs. of his weight that is demanded
by either ox or horse. What violence is done to this
demand of nature in the daily treatment of the hog!</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fresh, sound, wholesome food</i> is no less a <i>desideratum</i>. Yet the
omnivorous pig is condemned to become the scavenger for the
kitchen, the stable, the feeding pen, the slaughter house, the
creamery, the sugar works, the brewery and even the rendering
works. Whatever is considered unfit for human use is thrown
into a swill barrel, and as this is never emptied it becomes the
field of endless decompositions with the production of the most
varied toxins, ptomaines and enzymes. Many of these chemical
toxic products cause gastro-intestinal inflammation with vomiting,
bloody diarrhœa and tenesmus, and derangement of the nervous
and other functions as manifested in weakness, staggering, dulness,
stupor, etc. Death may follow in a few hours and the cases
are set down as acute forms of hog cholera, rather than the simple
poisoning that they are. All the same they pave the way for
the attack of hog cholera if its germ is present even in a form of
little potency. All such foods should, on the contrary, be fed
fresh and after boiling.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Salt</i> in excess, the <i>brine of salt meats or fish</i> (containing toxins),
the <i>powdered soaps</i> used in kitchens and added to swill, <i>mouldy
bread, cotton seed meal</i> fed in any considerable proportion in the
food, and even an exclusive diet of <i>corn</i> (maize), must be guarded
against.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowding of many pigs in a small yard where they root
continually in each others’ droppings and their own, should be
avoided. Individual pens, or pens holding two or three only
and kept clean are to be preferred, and still more a wide grassy
range where they may escape from their own filth. The long
feeding trough should be discarded in favor of one into which
the pig can introduce his nose only. The nose itself will introduce
filth ferments, but, where there are not specific-plague-germs,
it is the quantity that tells and the exclusion of the foul feet is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>an important consideration. To these various poisonous products
of saprophytic ferments it often happens that the older swine
have by continuous exposure, acquired a comparative immunity,
while the young growing pigs perish in large numbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Feeding pigs in confinement, without green or animal food is
very liable to induce costiveness and indigestion which pave the
way for the inroad of the hog-cholera germ. A certain allowance
of green food, slops, and, above all, a variety of food constituting
a well-balanced ration are always desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, the constitution of the pig is often material. On the
continent of Europe it is the high bred English pigs that suffer
most, and in all cases a lack of the rugged vigor attained through
an active, open air life lays the system more open to a violent attack.
Too close breeding must be similarly avoided, together
with breeding from the immature, the weak and the debilitated.
In this connection it is important to rid the herd of parasitisms
which not only weaken the system and lessen the power of resistance,
but by the bites or the inflammation induced, open
channels for the introduction of the hog-cholera bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevent the Introduction of the Bacillus.</i> The above precautions
are important in obviating infection and favoring a milder type
of the disease when the germ has been introduced, but they are
but palliatives at best, and will not hinder the development of a
plague in the presence of an active and potent virus. Adopted
alone they are worse than useless as a means of extinction of the
germ: they tend to preserve it. The exclusion of the hog-cholera
germ is the one essential thing in prevention and whatever comes
short of this must have at best but a partial effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>Avoid pens, pastures or streams that drain swine enclosures
higher up. Discard all provender or litter that has come in contact
with other pigs or their products. Allow no visitors to the
herd such as butchers, dealers, drovers, that have habitually
come in contact with other herds. Exclude as far as possible
domestic animals (dogs, sheep, cattle, fowls, pigeons), and even
vehicles coming from places where hogs are kept. Wild animals
such as buzzards, and other carrion feeders, must be especially
guarded against. Wild rabbits and hares (jack rabbits), skunks,
wood chucks, minks, rats and mice should be exterminated.
Small birds and flies are difficult to deal with but the latter may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>be destroyed by acids, copperas, or sulphites on the manure and
the former may even be exterminated when hog-cholera exists
in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sows should not be sent from herd to herd for service or otherwise,
and any swine that have been hired out, or sent to an exhibition,
and all that are acquired in any manner, should, on
arrival, be excluded from the herd and held in quarantine, well
apart for three or four weeks, and finally washed with carbolic
acid soap before they are admitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pestilential prevalence of hog cholera and other swine
plagues to-day is largely the result of the great industrial
and commercial activity of modern times. In America the disease
was comparatively unknown until after 1830, and in
Europe even later. But with the advent of steamboat and railroad,
the few pigs raised in separate pens, or secluded localities,
and killed and cured near by, gave place to the large herds, sent
when fattened to great markets where pigs were collected from
distances of many hundreds of miles, the stock animals and the
fat occupied in succession the same boats, cars and yards, and, as
a matter of course, the virulent germs were concentrated and
diffused through the infected places and things. We cannot go
back to the antiquated safer methods, but it would be possible to
so regulate our commerce, that the evil could be reduced to a
minimum. Separate cars, loading banks, chutes, alleyways, and
yards can be reserved for fat swine going to immediate slaughter
and no animal having passed through any of these should be
allowed to be taken out for stock purposes, unless it has been
passed through a rigid quarantine. The places and things used for
such fat swine should be disinfected at intervals, and the manure
and offal should be disinfected, or exposed to a boiling temperature
for a sufficient length of time before removal from the
premises. Stock swine on their part should be shipped only on
a certificate of the complete immunity of the herd and locality
from which they come from swine epizoötics, and of the roads or
vehicles by which they reached the shipping point. They should
be debarred from all yards, loading banks and cars or boats used
for fat hogs, and admitted only to such as have just passed
through a thorough disinfection. They should be sent directly
to their destination, or if to a market, for purposes of sale, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>should be well apart from that used for fat swine, and the loading
banks, chutes and yards should be entirely distinct and should be
thoroughly disinfected on every occasion after use. The millions
now lost yearly from swine epizoötics might well warrant the inconvenience
and expense entailed by such precautions. Heavy
penalties should be imposed on those shipping pigs from infected
localities, on those making false certificate, and on all who in any
way violate the law.</p>

<p class='c008'>Independently of State or local authorities the stock owner can
do much to protect himself. He can make a number of pens
large enough to hold 2 or 3 pigs each, safely fenced off from one
another and so constructed that no drainage can take place from
pen to pen. Then in winter in the absence of flies, and with
rats, mice, and birds excluded the opportunity for the extension
of infection from pen to pen can be kept at its minimum. All
pigs must be kept apart from the manure heap, and in summer
the manure must be so treated as to destroy the larvæ of flies.
All food and water that might convey infection must be guarded
against. Then if one pig is attacked it will only be necessary to
destroy it and its two fellows in the same pen, and even if those
in adjacent pens are killed or quarantined the loss will be a trifle
as compared to the ruin of the whole herd, as usually happens.
Prompt disinfection of the pens and manure is imperative, and
the same would apply to the person and clothes of the attendant,
and to all stable utensils.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization</i> by injection of <i>sterilized products</i> of the bacillus,
has not proved satisfactory. In 1880 I applied this to two pigs,
causing a transient fever, after recovery from which, the subjects
resisted exposure to infected pens and pigs, and even virulent
inoculations. But they failed to thrive well. Later experiments
by Drs. Salmon and DeSchweinitz respectively, also proved unsatisfactory.
The latter separated and injected the enzymes, but
lost 50 per cent of his cases, the survivors proving immune, with
the drawback of troublesome local lesions. The enzymes obtained
from cultures in milk could be used safely on guinea pigs in the
dose of 0.01 grams and in some cases even up to 0.04 securing
immunity. But the great risk of an overdose, the frequent local
lesions, and the subsequent unthrift, have prevented the adoption
of the method.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><i>Disinfection.</i> The experiments of the Bureau of Animal Industry
show that, apart from freezing, <i>four months in the soil</i>,
serves to render the bacillus harmless.</p>

<p class='c008'>From .75 to 1 per cent of quick lime added to soil in the form
of lime water, destroyed the virulence in 11 days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lime can be employed as a thick whitewash on pens, fences,
yards, etc., the precaution being taken to see that it is newly
burned, caustic and applied in sufficient amount. Lime that has
been kept absorbs carbon dioxide and loses its disinfectant property.
If ¼lb freshly made chloride of lime is added to each gallon
of the caustic lime white wash the certainty of success is
insured. Lime water has the advantage of being applicable to
grassy surfaces, without proving hurtful to the vegetation. For
buildings and yards it furnishes a ready means of estimating the
thoroughness of the application.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sulphuric acid</i> (1:100 or 1¼ oz. to 1 gallon) makes a good disinfectant
for buildings and yards. Like lime this can be used
freely without fear of poisoning the animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Carbolic Acid</i>, 5 per cent, can be used with great safety. The
Bureau of Animal Industry advises the combination of this with
sulphuric acid, which adds greatly to its solubility.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Formalin</i> may be employed, diluted one to forty of the solution
(1 per cent of the gas) in buildings and on woodwork generally.
It may also be applied in the form of gas by heating the solution
in closed rooms. Like carbolic acid it is especially applicable to
cars, boats, and other vehicles.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Corrosive Sublimate</i> (1:500) makes a convenient and cheap
disinfectant, with the drawback that it is poisonous, and destructive
to metals. <i>Mercuric Iodide</i> though more potent is also more
expensive. Blue stone (2:100) and zinc chloride (10:100) are
also effective but poisonous.</p>

<p class='c008'>The failure to <i>stamp out</i> hog cholera in England and America
has been largely chargeable on the appointment of laymen to do
the work of the expert, and no less so on the attempt to deal with
the disease in hogs in transit or in the market rather than in the
farm where they have been raised or kept. Let the fat and stock
markets be kept rigidly apart, together with the means of conveyance
to and from these, and let no stock swine start for a market
or destination without a certificate of the soundness of the locality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>from which they came, and the purity of the means of transit,
and we shall have taken a long step toward the final extinction of
the pest.</p>

<p class='c008'>State limits and rights stand in the way of successful work, but
this can be partly met by a frontier supervision by national officials,
and should be further, by a prompt and hearty coöperation
of the sanitary officers of the two states involved. When it
becomes possible to trace infecting hogs, back to the infected
place in another commonwealth, and punish the offender who
shipped them, we shall be within sight of a satisfactory control or
extinction of hog cholera.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Extinction of Hog Cholera in Herds and Districts.</i> As in all
deadly plagues this should be a recognized governmental function
to be carried out at public expense. It is a question of political
economy and its neglect is subversive of prosperity not in Agriculture
alone but in all public industries whose workers must
subsist on the fruits of the soil. The $10,000,000 lost yearly by
the farming community, is a dead loss, not to agriculture alone,
but to the prosperity of the nation, the markets of which would
be revived and improved by such a yearly sum expended.</p>

<p class='c008'>The existence of the disease at any point should be reported by
the stockowner or guardian, under penalty in case of failure.
When the nature of the outbreak has been certified by the expert,
the district should be scheduled, and the herd appraised,
slaughtered and all products disposed of in such a way as to prevent
any escape of infection. The carcasses may be burned,
buried deeply, or boiled and rendered. The buildings, yards,
utensils, fences, manure, cesspools, and infected fields should be
thoroughly disinfected, or secluded from all animals for a year.
The owners of the herd should be indemnified according to
appraisment, and not to exceed ¾ths of the actual market value,
provision being made that no award shall be made if the herd
sickened within a fortnight after their arrival from another State,
or in case the owner, has concealed the existence of the illness, or
has otherwise deliberately or carelessly contributed to its spread.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many minor rules and restrictions will be required to fit the
general measures to individual cases and local conditions, and
these require the direct supervision of an expert, and not of a
mere business manager or layman.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><i>Therapeutic Treatment.</i> With state, county or municipal
measures for the extinction of hog cholera, treatment is to be condemned,
as calculated to encrease and spread the infection. But
until the states can be educated out of the past wasteful system,
into economical measures of extinction, the swine breeders are
entitled to whatever salvage they can secure through therapeutics.
For acute cases there is no hope. For the <i>chronic</i> a clean, dry,
comfortable pen, well disinfected, and a moderate diet of varied
and laxative food are essential. Wheat, bran or middlings, with
corn, oat, barley or linseed meal may be allowed in form of a
mash. A little green vegetable food may be added. Medicinal
agents may be used to meet special indications, but when a whole
herd must be treated at once, antiseptics and febrifuges have apparently
proved the most generally helpful. The Bureau of
Animal Industry especially recommends the following: Wood
charcoal, sulphur, sodium sulphate and antimony sulphide, of
each 1 lb.; sodium chloride, bicarbonate and hyposulphite, of
each 2 lbs.; mix thoroughly and add to each feed in ratio with
the size of the patient. In suitable cases, this is said to improve
the appetite and contribute much to convalescence. Modifications
will readily suggest themselves to meet individual conditions and
different stages of the disease—antithermics, eliminants, calmatives.
stimulants, tonics, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Serum Therapy.</i> This has been especially exploited and advocated
in America by De Schweinitz of the Bureau of Animal
Industry, and Dr. Peters of Lincoln, Neb. In Europe, Perroncito
has prepared an antitoxin. The serum is produced in the body of
the cow or other animal which is inoculated repeatedly with gradually
encreasing doses of living hog cholera cultures and with solutions
of the bacilli and their products, for a period of eight months,
or until no reaction takes place from large doses, and the blood
serum added to cultures of hog cholera bacilli causes agglutination
of the latter. The serum is further tested as to its power of
preserving Guinea pigs inoculated with a lethal dose of live hog
cholera cultures. After separation from the blood the serum is
concentrated until it reaches a standard at which 10cc. proves
curative to a pig of 40 to 60 lbs. weight.</p>

<p class='c008'>It proves most successful in animals in which the subacute or
chronic form of the disease has just begun. One injection only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>was given to each animal. Of 1923 cases treated (1897–8) 30 per
cent. died, and 70 per cent. recovered. Of 3197 in abandoned
herds (checks), 81.24 per cent. were lost. (De Schweinitz.)</p>

<p class='c008'>One drawback was found in the short period of immunity
secured, the susceptibility reappearing as soon as the antitoxin
had been eliminated from the body. This was met in part by
using sterilized cultures (toxins) along with the serum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another desideratum was a speedy means of distinguishing in
field work between hog cholera and swine plague, as the antitoxin
of the one was not protective against the other. To meet this,
serum was obtained from an animal immunized to both diseases,
or a mixture was made of the sera of two animals respectively
made resistant to the two affections.</p>

<p class='c008'>De Schweinitz was very optimistic in the matter, claiming that
the serum is absolutely harmless, can be used on pigs freely, and
will cost but 15 cents for each animal. He estimated that of the
$15,000,000 per annum lost by Hog Cholera and Swine Plague in
Iowa alone, $11,000,000 can be saved at a comparatively small
cost.</p>

<p class='c008'>The method is scientifically sound in availing of the defensive
products of the immunized system for imparting to the animal
attacked, the power of vital resistance, and after allowing for enthusiasm,
for the inevitable mistakes, when used on a large scale,
of other deadly swine diseases for hog cholera, for the many accidents
incident to its application by operators who are not specially
trained like the employés of the Bureau, for its demand for acute
and deadly outbreaks, as well as for chronic and mild ones, and
taking into account that in other hands it has not fully borne out
the promise made for it; yet it seems to have some measure of
merit, and where no systematic attempt is made by the authorities
for the extinction of the disease and its germ, it is an available
resort for the owner of herds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fundamental objection is that it entails the preservation,
encrease and spread of the poison, and like all temporizing measures,
stands as a barrier to the complete extinction of the plague.
Giving such a very transient protection, its repetition may be demanded
in a few months or a year, and proceeding on the ground
that the pest must continue for all time, the apparent economy of
the process will prove, in the long run, but a permanent and
grievous tax.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The soundest and only truly economical course in dealing with
this and other deadly infections of swine is the radical extinction
of the germ. When the people can be educated up to this we
shall see the dawn of a brilliant future for our animal industries.
Until then we must be satisfied to fall back upon, and make the
best use of the temporizing measures now in vogue or that may
hereafter be devised. Even if it should be shown that hog cholera
is at long intervals developed from a ‘sport’ of the usually
harmless bacillus coli commune, the fact remains that its great
extensions and the resulting fatality are due to the contagion
alone, so that extinction remains the true watchword of success
and economy.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SWINE PLAGUE: SEPTICÆMIA HÆMORRHAGICA SUIS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Definition. Synonym. Bacillus pestis suis, 0.8–1.5μ, nonmotile. Pathogenesis.
Accessory causes, as in hog cholera: less vitality than in virus of
hog cholera, bacillus in apparently healthy, deadly to birds and rodents.
Lesions: like as in hæmorrhagic septicæmia, lungs suffer more than bowels,
lymph glands swollen hæmorrhagic, liver and spleen may seem almost normal,
bowels slightly congested, marked emaciation. Symptoms: Acute
cases like hog cholera, shorter incubation—1 day, troubled breathing when
driven, cough, congested petechiated skin, hyperthermia, costiveness followed
by diarrhœa. Diagnosis: constancy and predominance of lung
lesions and symptoms, nonmotile bacillus with polar staining, not gasogenic
with glucose, very fatal to birds and rodents. Prevention: as in hog
cholera. Immunization. Treatment: as in hog cholera dangerous. Serum-therapy.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> A contagious bacteridian disease of swine, acute or
subacute, characterized by a short incubation, hyperthermia,
marked congestion of the mucosæ, petechiæ and circumscribed
blood extravasations in the skin, subcutis, mucosæ, submucosæ,
and tissues, swelling, congestion and petechiation of the lymph
glands, and a marked tendency to inflammatory localization in the
lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Synonyms.</i> Th. Smith identifies this affection with the
“Schweineseuche” of Germany.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology. The bacillus of Swine Plague</i> (<i>B. Pestis Suis</i>)
has already been described in the differential table of allied bacteria
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>given under hog cholera. It is a short rod, with rounded
ends, 0.8 to 1.5μ. × 0.6 to 0.8μ, staining readily in aqueous basic
aniline colors and bleaching in Gram’s iodine solution. The
staining is distinctly polar, the colored portions being more or
less crescentic with the concave or straight border turned inward
toward the central clear space. It is destitute of flagella and distinctly
nonmotile unlike the very active bacillus of hog cholera.
It further differs in its growth on potato which is slight, gray and
waxy. On gelatine, too, it gives a feeble growth (or none) unlike
the brownish colonies of the bacillus of hog cholera. It fails
to liquefy gelatin. On agar the growth is more active, being
grayish, translucent or brown. Those forming under the surface
are like flat horizontal discs with a small microscopic elevation or
knob in the center. It grows in milk producing little or no acid
and no clot. It produces gas with none of the sugars—glucose,
lactose, saccharose—in contrast with the gas production in glucose
by the hog cholera bacillus. It shows much less vitality and
hardihood than the hog cholera bacillus, growing but feebly
between 65° and 70° F., and most actively at 97° to 100° F.; dying
in 7 minutes at a temperature of 58° (moist); dying in 3 days
when dried, in 4 to 6 days in the soil, in 10 to 15 days in water
and instantly in 0.04 per cent solution of lime water.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathogenesis.</i> It is pathogenic to swine, hens, pigeons, pheasants,
sparrow, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, cattle, deer, etc., showing
not only a wider range than the hog cholera bacillus, but a
more deadly action outside the genus suis. Inoculated birds die
in 2 days, rabbits in 16 to 20 hours and guineapigs in 1 to 4 days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> These agree in the main with those of hog
cholera already described so that it is needless to repeat them
here. The principal distinctions depend on the lesser vitality
of the swine plague bacillus outside of the animal body, and its
wider range of pathogenesis outside the genus suis. Infecting
materials that have been thoroughly dry for a week may be considered
harmless, also that which has been more than two weeks
in water, and that which has been more than a week in the soil.
If, therefore, the buildings have been thoroughly disinfected, the
simple disuse of yards and pastures for a fortnight, and of ponds
of water for three weeks may suffice. In the case of hog
cholera it may be necessary to abandon such places for 5 months
or for the season.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Abandonment by swine is, however, insufficient: all susceptible
animals, wild and tame, (see pathogenesis) must be excluded as
any one of these may maintain the infection. The preservation
of recovered swine on the premises, or the early return of the
immune may become a means of preserving the bacillus for the
next susceptible pigs that may be introduced. The bacillus of
swine plague may be found on the air passages of swine and
other animals that are not themselves, at the time, susceptible to
the disease, and these animals accordingly become the occasions
of what have been thought to be spontaneous outbreaks, and of
invasions of fresh herds after the introduction of healthy pigs
which have been thought to be beyond suspicion. The danger
of the communication of the germ by wild birds and rodents
would be enormous, but for the fact that it is so much more
deadly to these animals than the microbe of hog cholera, that few
survive to maintain the infection. Yet the rule ought to be, to exclude
from the fields or premises occupied by new or susceptible
pigs, all animals, that may by any possibility become the means
of introducing the infection so recently prevalent. Though so
easily destroyed when outside the living body, the microbe of
swine plague can be carried by the apparently healthy living
animal and we must rigidly exclude the possibility of this occurring.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> <i>Acute</i> and <i>rapidly fatal cases</i> of swine plague furnish
lesions indicative of a hæmorrhagic septicæmia. The abundance
of petechiæ on the skin, mucosæ, serosæ, and tissues generally,
with circumscribed hæmorrhages, congestions, inflammations and
exudations, agree in the main with what is observed in the acute
examples of hog cholera. If the congestive or inflammatory
lesions, concentrate in the lungs rather than the bowels it assists
in the diagnosis of swine plague. The swelling and blood engorgement
of the lymph glands are nearly alike in the more acute
types of the two diseases. The spleen is less constantly enlarged
than in hog cholera or swine erysipelas. In the <i>subacute</i> and
<i>chronic forms</i> the lesions may be almost entirely confined to the
enlarged and congested or hæmorrhagic lymph glands. Usually,
however, the lungs are the seat of lobular or lobar pneumonia,
affecting by preference the lower portions of the anterior and
median lobes, and sometimes also the posterior lobe. The pleuræ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>are often involved, showing arborescent congestion, thickening,
exudate, false membranes and hydrothorax. The exudate
may at times fill up the interlobular connective tissue, even before
the pulmonary tissue is materially involved suggesting a local infection
starting at the pleural surface. The hepatised lobule has
a general red color varying in depth at different points, and
showing lighter yellowish or grayish spots representing the purulent
air sacs and terminal bronchia, and necrotic foci. On section
the bronchia often yield pus, while the pulmonary tissue oozes a
bloody liquid rich in small lymphoid cells.</p>

<p class='c008'>The liver and spleen may be all but normal, though in a number
of cases they may be congested and softened. The stomach
and bowels may be virtually sound, or they may show extensive
congestion, petechiation and thickening of the mucosa at different
points, with, in some cases ulcers, but these latter are mostly
excavated and rarely assume the projecting, button-like, laminated
form which is so characteristic of chronic hog cholera. Emaciation
is a marked feature as in hog-cholera.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> In the most acute type these may not differ from
those of similar cases of hog-cholera. If there has been any opportunity
of estimating the incubation it will be found to have
been shorter, the skin and mucosæ have a darker red blush,
showing first on the ears, breast, belly and inner sides of the
thighs and forearms, the lymph glands are enlarged, and there
is cough and dyspnœa if the patient is roused to exertion. The
presence of petechiæ on the skin and of a very high temperature
(107° to 109°) is to be specially noted. There are great prostration
and dulness, complete anorexia, hiding under the litter,
indisposition to rise, often weakness, staggering, paresis or even
paraplegia, somnolence, and death in coma or convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>subacute</i> and <i>protracted</i> cases, there is the short incubation
(1 day), followed by hyperthermia, drooping tail, hiding
under the litter, flushed eyes, nose and mouth, impaired appetite,
arched loins, hollow flanks, retracted abdomen, cough easily
roused by driving, and signs of consolidated lungs in their lower
parts (crepitation, suppressed murmur, abdominal or heart sounds
etc.). After a day or two the skin becomes flushed and together
with the visible mucosæ the seat of petechiæ. The superficial
lymph glands are enlarged. The bowels are usually confined but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>as the disease advances diarrhœa may set in. There is rapid
loss of condition, and the patient may die as the result of exhaustion,
toxin poisoning, colliquative diarrhœa, or other condition.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis during life</i> is based largely on the shorter incubation,
the greater reddening of the visible mucosæ, the comparative absence
of abdominal tenderness, and offensive diarrhœa, and the
constancy of the cough and other symptoms of broncho-pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Post-mortem.</i> It is marked by the constancy and predominance
of the lung lesions, and the comparative absence of ulceration of
the ileum, cæcum and colon, and especially of the projecting,
laminated, button-like, necrotic sloughs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morphology of the bacillus, its habit of polar staining, its
lack of automatic movements, its comparatively poor growth in
alkaline bouillon, on potato, gelatine and agar, its inability to
ferment glucose with the production of gas, its rapidly fatal action
on hens and pigeons as well as on rabbits and guinea pigs serve
to distinguish it from the microbe of hog cholera. (See table
p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> In this connection the reader is referred to the
precautions, given under hog cholera, against conditions, hereditary,
hygienic, climatic, dietetic, parasitic, etc., which lay the
system more open to microbian invasion. In the matter of exclusion
of the bacillus, the swine plague germ is less difficult to deal
with, because it is so much more easily destroyed. Disinfect the
buildings, and all contaminated objects as advised under hog
cholera, clean yards, and shut up these and pastures or runs, and
all infected water for one month. In case of public market yards
and alleys, and railway loading banks, chutes, and cars, a
thorough cleansing and disinfection may warrant that they may
be put to use again immediately. No animals that occupied the
yards before disinfection should be allowed to mingle with the
new stock, as they at times carry the microbe, though themselves
apparently healthy and immune. All regulations as to railway
and boat transit, recommended under hog cholera, are equally
applicable to swine plague. The possibility of protecting private
herds, by keeping them in special pens, holding two or three
each, is also the same for swine plague.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization</i> is somewhat more promising than in hog cholera.
Metchinkoff and Th. Smith working independently found a fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>measure of success in inoculating rabbits and guinea pigs with
three to five small injections of sterilized bouillon cultures, agar
cultures or blood, intravenously, intraabdominally or hypodermically.
But as applied to swine it has not proved satisfactory, and
the irregularity of the results and the tendency to induce unthriftiness
have caused it to be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> The therapeutics of swine plague like that of hog
cholera is essentially unsatisfactory. Benefit might be derived in
individual cases from a careful and judicious use of drugs to
meet the special indications, but with the comparatively low
value of the individual animal, the certainty of the multiplication
of the deadly poison by the preservation of the diseased,
and the extreme danger of its diffusion and extension, treatment
is anything but commendable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Serum-therapy</i> has been advocated for years by De Schweinitz,
and under the auspices of the Bureau of Animal Industry it has
been given a wide trial, but it has not met with the full success
that was at first claimed for it. The serum is prepared in a similar
way to that of hog cholera and is similarly employed. It is
open to the same class of objections, and though when skillfully
employed it will reduce the mortality, it does not yet seem to
have reached the point at which it can be recommended as a
profitable investment. Like all temporizing measures it draws
attention from the sounder and more economical measure of extinction
and is indirectly a means of the perpetuation and even
the diffusion of the infection. So long as extinction cannot be
secured, this is a less valuable alternative for the adoption of
owners of high priced hogs.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MODIFIED AND COMPLEX FEVERS OF SWINE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Double infections. Varieties of bacillus choleræ suis, and bacillus suis pestis.
McFadyean’s swine fever bacillus. Marseilles swine plague bacillus.</p>

<p class='c007'>We accept fully the duality of the Hog Cholera and Swine
Plague, though this duality has been hotly contested on both
sides of the Atlantic. Many of the best observers in Europe
now support this position. These include Selander, Bang and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Jensen who are familiar with the <i>svinpest</i> (hog cholera) of
Scandinavia; Kitt, Friedberger and Fröhner who are familiar
with the <i>Schweineseuche</i> (swine plague) of Germany; Raccugla,
Canova and others in Southern Europe; and Lignieres and others
in France who have studied the hog cholera and <i>pasturellose porcine</i>
(swine plague).</p>

<p class='c008'>But the conceded duality of these two diseases as they occur in
typical examples in swine, does not account for all the infectious
fevers of swine, in which these microbes or others closely allied
to them may figure. Salmon, Smith and their coadjutors describe
double infections in the same system, in which both the bacillus
choleræ suis and the bacillus pestis suis figure, and in which there
result a combination of symptoms and lesions, that together
represent both of these germs. It may be that one or other of
these germs in a given outbreak, shows a predominance in potency
so that the symptoms are more characteristic of it than of
its companion; it may be that the more potent germ kills the
victim, quickly by an acute septicæmia and gross lesions that
would apply almost as well to one germ as to the other; or it
may be that both act moderately and the attack is protracted with
resulting lesions in both lungs and bowels that respectively suggest
the plague and the cholera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then as regards varieties in the individual germ. Th. Smith
recognizes this as a frequent condition and describes no less than
seven different types of bacillus choleræ suis which he had
studied and which varied in morphology, cultural qualities and
virulence. Lignieres found that the virulence especially of
bacillus suis pestis is very easily affected by successive passages
through the bodies of small experimental animals. We ought
not to be surprised then if we find in different epizoötics, in
different countries and even in the same, bacilli which for the
time at least show characteristics different from those to which we
have been accustomed. These give us varying phases of septicæmia
which however come together in one great class. Two
of these types which have been placed on record may be here
named. For others see septicæmia hæmorrhagica of cattle and
sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>McFadyean’s Swine Fever Bacillus.</b> The characters of
this microbe found constantly by McFadyean in swine fever,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>approximates closely to the hog cholera germ in morphology
and motility and in its deadly action when eaten, while it approaches
toward the swine plague germ in its cultural habits on
potato, gelatine and agar, and in alkaline culture liquids, and
finally it differs from both in the absence of pathogenesis to
Guinea pigs and in its very moderate action on rabbits. The
symptoms and lesions of the <i>swine fever</i> of Great Britain are
those of the <i>hog cholera</i> of America rather than of swine plague.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Marseilles Swine Plague Bacillus.</b> This microbe was
found by Rietsch and Jobert in a febrile epizoötic of swine at
Marseilles, and was studied by Caneva and Bunzl-Federn separately.
The latter identified it with the bacillus of ferret septicæmia,
as described by Eberth and Schimmelbusch. It was
longer and thicker than the hog cholera bacillus, twice as long
as broad, actively motile, with flagella, and differed from bacillus
choleræ suis, in its polar staining, its free growth in acid media,
in acidifying and coagulating milk, and in its forming both indol
and phenol in peptonized bouillon.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this case the source of the disease was in importations from
Africa (Fouquet), and it spread widely in Southern France for
nine months. It proved almost constantly fatal, in from four
days to two or three weeks. The symptoms were weakness
especially in the hind limbs, with more or less fever, constipation
often followed by diarrhœa, an infrequent cough, and red blotches
on the skin. In chronic cases ulcers formed in the mouth and
intestines especially the cæcum and colon. Appetite was often
retained to the end. The young, under a year old, were the
chief sufferers. It made 20,000 victims in several months in the
province of Bouches-du-Rhone.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Wild—und Rinderseuche (Bollinger), Buffalo Disease,
Barbone (Oreste and Armanni), Cornstalk Disease (Billings,
Moore), Sporadic Pneumonia (Smith), Pneumo-enteritis
(Galtier.)</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An acute bacteridian disease of domestic and wild
herbivora and swine, characterized by sudden onset, rapid and
fatal course, marked hyperthermia, accelerated breathing and
pulse, and extensive gelatinoid or sanguineous extravasation in
the intermaxillary space, tongue, skin, subcutaneous or intermuscular
connective tissue, lungs, pleura, pericardium or intestine.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Historic Notes.</i> It is almost certain that in earlier times this
affection was often mistaken for gloss-anthrax, blackquarter, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>even lung plague. Metaxa, in 1816 in Italy, manifestly describes
it. Oreste and Armanni, in 1882 and 1887, traced Italian cases
to the microbe. In 1854 it destroyed many cattle and deer in
England (Veterinarian). In 1878 Bollinger records its great
fatality among the deer, wild boars, cattle and horses in and near
the royal parks at Munich, and for a number of years after in
Bavaria. Friedberger records its presence in Schlüchtern, Prussia,
in 1885–6, Condamine in Cochin China in 1868, and Guillbeau
and Hess in Switzerland in 1894. In America, what appears
to be the same affection is noted as corn-fodder disease in Nebraska
(Billings), as Wildseuche in Tennessee (Norgaard), and as
hæmorrhagica septicæmia in Minnesota (Reynolds). I have
repeatedly met with the affection in New York in cows arriving
from the west, and in the indigenous cattle on wet, mucky, undrained
land in spring, about the period of the melting snows.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> The essential cause of the disease is a saprophytic
cocco-bacillus, ovoid, with rounded ends, about 1μ long by
0.3 to 0.6μ broad, but showing involution forms and a variable
size. It is nonmotile (Kitt claims motility), ærobic (facultative
anærobic), takes a polar stain with clear centre in aniline colors,
bleaches in Gram’s (1) solution, shows neither spores nor flagella,
grows readily in bouillon, on gelatine, (a bluish transparent layer
without liquefying), serum at 98° F., milk (without acidifying or
coagulating), and alkaline potato (not on the acid). The cultures
have a peculiar odor and yield no indol.</p>

<p class='c008'>The microbe shows a very close relationship with those of
swine plague, chicken cholera and rabbit septicæmia, but it sometimes
differs in showing little or no pathogenesis for the Guinea-pig.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> It is pathogenic to deer, buffalo, cattle,
horses, swine, rabbits, rats, mice, and to a lesser extent to goats
and sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>pathogenesis</i> varies with the immediate source of the
microbe. When obtained from cattle a drop of blood kills rabbits
in twelve to twenty hours, with intense hæmorrhagic laryngitis
and tracheitis. Guinea pigs die in forty to eighty hours. When
obtained from the buffalo it killed horse, ox, or pig in twenty to
forty-eight hours. That obtained from barbone (buffalo) appears
to be more potent than that from septicæmia hæmorrhagica
(cattle).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><i>Vitality of the microbe.</i> Simple drying destroys virulence in
six to twenty-two days. Virulence is retained for nine days in
putrid flesh. It is preserved, and the microbe multiplies in soil
or water containing organic matter and nitrates. It is easily
destroyed by ordinary antiseptics 1:5000 of mercuric chloride destroying
its vitality in one minute (Hueppe). On the contrary it
shows a great resistance to changes of temperature. It grows in
the soil at 55° to 60° F. (Hueppe), and in old cultures may
resist for an hour a temperature of 175° to 195° (Oreste and
Armanni).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> These are such conditions as favor transmission
of, or receptivity to the microbe. In Southern France the
disease is most common in the winter months, probably because
the soil water rises then; on the Roman marshes on the other
hand, it prevails especially from May to October, when the water
is lowest and most impure. In New York I have seen it especially
at the breaking up of the winter frosts, when the water, pent
up in the rich organic soils, is suddenly released. It is pre-eminently
the disease of wet soils, rich in the debris of decomposing
organic matter, of the rich prairies and bottom lands of the Mississippi
Valley, of springy, swampy or mucky soils elsewhere,
of the Pontine marshes at Rome, of the Delta of the Nile, of the
rich virgin soils in Asia. Youth has the greatest receptivity, the
older animals having probably acquired immunity through an
earlier attack. The animals that live in herds infect each other
by contact, fighting, licking, etc., others are affected by eating
the vegetation or drinking the water soiled by the diseased, wild
boars by eating the carcasses, and all animals by the attacks of biting
or blood-sucking insects which have just come from the diseased.
It is claimed that the infection is carried by men and animals,
and by the sale in villages of the flesh of infected animals.
Dogs, wolves, foxes, and other carnivorous animals and birds will
also carry the infection for long distances. Finally, it will travel
to a greater or lesser distance with running water.</p>

<p class='c008'>The entrance of the microbe by wounds must always be counted
on, and explains the casual inoculations, by bites of dogs, insects,
worms, by barbed wire fences, by wounds with horns,
tusks, or feet, by nails, etc., and in winter by hard, woody aliment
scratching the lips, mouth, fauces or pharynx. Shedding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of teeth, diseased teeth or gums, and everything that causes
abrasion of the alimentary mucosa must be admitted into the list
of causes. Infected traumatisms of any kind, like intratracheal
and intravenous inoculations usually prove fatal, while infection
by ingestion is not necessarily so. The pathogenic potency appears
to be impaired in the stomach or intestines.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> These vary widely according to the subject, the
seat of infection and the violence of the attack. They may be
classed under three principal heads: <i>superficial</i>, <i>thoracic</i> and <i>intestinal</i>,
and in addition into <i>acute</i> and <i>chronic</i> cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>superficial</i>, <i>external</i> or <i>cutaneous form</i> there is usually a
sudden onset with high fever (104° to 107° F.), accelerated pulse,
(70 to 90), and breathing (24 to 50), anorexia, suspended rumination,
muscular tremors or shivering, staring coat, dry, hot
muzzle, burning of ears, horns and hoofs, suppression of milk,
and more or less stringy salivation. The visible mucosæ are of
a deep red or violet tinge, and the patient will often remain apart
by himself when the herd has moved elsewhere. Soon there develops
a tense, hard, hot, painful swelling of the intermaxillary
space, tongue, throat, neck, dewlap or elsewhere, amounting to
perhaps six inches in thickness, extremely resistant and not
usually indented on pressure with the finger. The breathing becomes
stertorous and deglutition difficult or impossible. The
mouth is hot and filled with tenacious saliva, and the tongue may
hang pendant while on its borders and lower surface are projections
of the mucosa swollen by infiltration, yellowish and semi-transparent,
or blood-stained. At other points petechiæ are more
or less abundant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Death may take place from pharyngeal obstruction or closure,
or as the disease advances, there may be indications of implication
of the viscera, of the chest or abdomen: encreasingly difficult
breathing, a mucous or suffocative cough, colicy pains, tenesmus,
and the passage of moulded glazed fæces, of pseudo-membranous
casts, or of profuse liquid stools. The animal may move the hind
feet uneasily, lie down and rise alternately, may remain persistently
recumbent until death, or he may stand up until he falls
to perish of asphyxia. Death may occur in six hours, or may
be delayed four days.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>thoracic form</i> the extreme hyperthermia is complicated
by early lesions in the lungs, while the muscular or cutaneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>ones are omitted or deferred. So long as the lesions are confined
to the chest, they are betrayed by hurried and even oppressed
breathing or dyspnœa, a frequent, moist, suffocative cough, persistent
standing to favor respiration, and there are the percussion
and auscultation indications of consolidated lungs or hydrothorax.
The mucosæ are usually of a darker red, than in the external
form, cyanotic indeed, and the peculiar asphyxial position, with
legs apart, head extended, dilated nostrils and open mouth may
be very significant. These symptoms are likely to be modified
or supplemented before death, by those caused by intestinal or
renal disorder. In the thoracic form in young animals death by
suffocation may occur in a few hours, but more commonly the
disease progresses slowly and a fatal result is not reached until
the fourth day or even the eighth. This form is common in the
deer, and less so in cattle.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>intestinal</i> or <i>abdominal form</i> the usual sudden onset and
high fever, are complicated by inappetence, tympany, rumbling
of the bowels, uneasy movements of the hind feet, perhaps twisting
of the tail, looking at the flanks, and even lying down and
rising. There is frequent, violent straining with the passage of
fæces at first glazed, later streaked with blood, or mixed with
pseudo-membranous casts, and very soon soft, watery, frothy and
fœtid. These are usually black or reddish black from contained
blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The urine may also be blood-stained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before death, complications on the lungs or skin will often come
in to assist in diagnosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>chronic</i> and <i>subacute types</i> the lesions are often concentrated
on the lungs, and there are a moderate fever cough,
hurried breathing under exertion, dulness on percussion over
limited pulmonary areas, blowing sounds, mucous râles, crepitations
and more or less muco-purulent expectoration. These
phenomena are all the more significant if complicated by digestive
disorders, costiveness, fœtid mucous diarrhœa, tympany, or by
the eruption of the superficial swellings.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The swellings on or <i>under the skin</i> or among the
<i>muscles</i> show extensive straw-colored exudations, colored at points
with blood, with enlargement, infiltration and staining of the
adjacent lymph glands. On the chest walls the sero-sanguineous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>exudate may extend from the root of the lungs, through the intercostal
spaces to the skin in the breast, the axilla and behind.
The tongue is often enormously swollen and black, charged with
extensive blood extravasations in addition to the yellowish exudate.
Along its sides and on its lower surface, the mucosa stands
out in projecting masses of yellowish infiltration, which may show
equally on the fauces, pharynx, larynx, trachea and bronchi.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>lungs</i> the pleuræ and subpleural and interlobular tissue
are extensively infiltrated and thickened by a profuse yellowish
serous or sero-sanguineous exudate, so that the appearance may
closely resemble that of lung plague. The lung tissue is consolidated,
hepatized and dark red, with at some points emphysema.
The pleural sac is usually filled by a serous or bloody effusion
(2 to 25 quarts) and there is often extensive implication of the
pericardium. The tracheo-bronchial mucosa and bronchial glands
show extensive infiltration and thickening.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>abdomen</i> are found extensive infiltrations and blood
extravasations in the mucosa and submucosa of the stomachs and
intestines, softening and shedding of the epithelium, infiltrations
of the peritoneum, diaphragm, and sublumbar adipose tissue, and
softening and degeneration of the liver and kidneys. The intestinal
gastric and mesenteric glands are usually infiltrated, softened
and blood-stained. Engorgement of the spleen is exceptional.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>blood</i> is very black but not usually materially changed in
consistency nor coagulability. Petechiation of the different
serosæ and other tissues is a prominent feature.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>chronic cases</i> the lesions are mostly shown in the lungs and
lymph glands. The lungs show circumscribed lobular islets of
congestion, induration or caseation, offering a suggestion of
tubercle, which is all the more deceptive when cretifaction has
set in. The caseous centres may vary in size from a pea to a
walnut, and some may have ruptured to form a vomica discharging
into a bronchium. Bronchia leading to affected lobules are
blocked with muco-purulent matter, yellowish, thick and tenacious,
and their mucosa is thickened and puckered. The enlarged
lymph glands are especially those of the bronchia, trachea, mediastinum,
bowels, mesentery and sublumbar region.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacillus is present in the exudate but is especially abundant
in the blood, and in the chronic cases in the bronchial mucous.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><i>Diagnosis.</i> From <i>anthrax</i> (gloss-anthrax) this affection is
easily distinguished by the absence from the blood and exudates
of the large, square ended anthrax bacillus, by the absence of enlargement
and blood engorgement of the spleen, and of the softness
and diffluence of the blood clot which characterize anthrax.
Swine which are with difficulty inoculated with anthrax are very
susceptible to hæmorrhagic septicæmia. Sheep which are very
receptive to anthrax are somewhat refractory to the disease now
in hand. Pigeons resist anthrax but readily contract septicæmia
hæmorrhagica.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>black quarter</i> it is readily distinguished by the absence of
emphysema and crepitation and of a secondary cooling in the
external swellings, by the presence of the germ in abundance in
the blood, by its smaller size, its bipolar staining, and its lack of
motility and of spores. Inoculation with black quarter bacillus
kills the guinea pig, but spares the pigeon.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>lung plague</i> it is distinguished by the suddenness of its
attack and rapidity of its progress to a fatal issue; by the usual
coincidence of skin and bowel lesions, while the lung plague affects
the chest only; by its communicability to pigs, sheep, pigeons,
and even horses, which are all immune from lung plague; and by
the usual absence of lung lesions of different ages, which are so
characteristic of lung plague. The abundance in the blood of the
cocco-bacillus with bipolar staining in hæmorrhagic septicæmia is
characteristic. <i>Lung plague</i> spreads slowly to exposed cattle,
but spares all other domestic animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>Rinderpest</i> it is differentiated by the history of its advent,
by the presence of the surface œdematous swellings, by the
absence of the whitish epithelial concretions on the mouth or
vulva, and of the deep dark portwine discolorations of the mucosæ
of the mouth, rectum and vulva, and by the fact of its inoculability
on domestic animals generally. Rinderpest spreads rapidly
to all exposed ruminants, but spares pigs, rabbits, Guinea pigs,
horses and birds.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>malignant œdema</i> it differs in its inoculability on the
surface in place of subcutaneously only, in the presence of the
cocco-bacillus in the blood during life, whereas in malignant
œdema the germ is confined to the local lesion, in the absence of
crepitation, which may be present in the swelling of œdema, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the greater facility with which cultures can be made of the septicæmic
cocco-bacillus and in the absence of gas production in
such cultures. The malignant œdema comes from a single accidental
deep inoculation from almost any rich soil, and is not a
malady spreading widely and generally on given limited damp,
rich lands which have become infected. Finally the cocco-bacillus
of septicæmia hæmorrhagica is found singly in the blood
or exudate, whereas the microbes of malignant œdema may be
found in form of sporeless filaments intermingled with the bacilli.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality.</i> The hæmorrhagic septicæmia of cattle cuts off
from 50 to 80 per cent. of the animals attacked.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> The first consideration is to isolate and kill all the
affected animals, to destroy the carcasses by burning or boiling
and to burn or disinfect all objects that may have become contaminated.
The buildings, yards, and fences, must be disinfected,
and as the bacillus is very resistant a solution of corrosive sublimate
and sodium chloride, a drachm of each to the gallon of
water may be freely used after thorough cleansing. Or a whitewash
containing ¼ lb. chloride of lime to each gallon may be
substituted. Feeding and drinking troughs may be burned.
Manure may be freely treated with sulphuric acid. Infected
fields should be closed for years and if possible drained.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization</i> of buffalo and sheep has been secured by making
cultures of the microbe in free air at 86° to 90° F. and inoculating
the animals with the weakened virus, on three successive occasions
with intervals of several days. It induces a transient fever,
with no serious phenomena (Oreste and Armanni). A second
available method is to pass the virus through the system of the
pigeon and inoculate with the pigeon’s blood, on three successive
occasions, the animals to be protected. It is manifestly impossible
to put such immunizing methods in force on wild deer, and for
these probably the best course is to drive them from the infected
range, to an uninfected one, having retained them for a few days
interval in a confined area, to allow of any already infected animals
developing the disease. A similar avoidance of waters running
from the infected tract is imperative.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i>, has been unsuccessful. Friedberger failed with
hypodermic injection of carbolic acid, and internal administration
of salicylic acid. Gal gave subcutem 5 per cent. solution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of creolin, and doses of 1½ oz. of the same agent by the mouth.
Five buffaloes out of seventeen recovered. Friedberger suggests
deep incisions of the swellings so as to admit the air, and treatment
of the wounds with strong antiseptics.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Pasteurellosis Ovina. Infectious Pneumo-Enteritis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An infectious febrile affection of the sheep, chronic
or acute, characterized by dulness, stiffness, or paresis, anorexia,
thirst, disorder of the breathing and digestive organs, black diffluent
blood, petechiæ, reddish effusions in the serosæ or connective
tissue, and congestive or inflammatory lesions of the lungs,
liver, kidneys and intestines. The presence of a cocco-bacillus
(diplococcus, strepto-cocco-bacillus, pasteurellosa) in the lesions
is especially characteristic.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> Though Lignieres first demonstrated
this as a bacteridian disease in the Argentine Republic, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>was, after his return, able to identify the same affection in the
flocks of almost every department of France, in newly imported
English Lincolns and German Merinos, so that there can be
little doubt that the malady exists in all or nearly all countries
engaged in sheep husbandry, though it has been usually attributed
to parasitisms of the lungs, liver or alimentary canal alone.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The essential cause is manifestly the bacillus, which
Lignieres has isolated, cultivated in vitro, and successfully inoculated
intravenously in the sheep, which he also infected by feeding
the pure cultures. Intravenously it proved fatal to Guinea pig,
rabbit, pigeon, chicken, rat, mouse, horse, ass and ox. Yet
many other accessory causes must be admitted as operating in
different cases.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Youth</i> shows the greatest susceptibility whether the victim be
mammal or bird. So marked is this influence that the principle
sufferers are lambs just weaned or yearlings. Yet mature animals,
that are debilitated from any cause, also fall victims. The
measure of immunity usually noticed in mature sheep may well
be attributed to a previous mild and non-fatal attack of the
bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Verminous affections</i> are undoubtedly predisposing causes,
hence, the common practice of attributing the malady to the
worms alone. This again in part explains the susceptibility of
the young which so often harbor worms to a dangerous extent.
It seems to matter less what worms are present than, that they
are in sufficient numbers to greatly deteriorate the health. It is
noticeable, however, that those worms that make breaches in the
mucosæ, have been noted as infesting the victims of this malady.
In the stomach worms sent from Argentina, Railliet identified
Strongylus Contortus, S. circumcentus, and S. instabilis and in
the duodenum S. filicollis and S. Curticei. These, like the distomata
often found in the liver, are blood suckers and not only
render the animal anæmic, but make numerous perforations to
act as infection-atria. The various lung worms, encysting themselves
in the air sacs and determining local congestions may act
in the same way, opening channels for the entrance of the microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Low condition</i> or a <i>low tone</i> of health from any cause predisposes.
Old, worn out animals, ewes in lamb, or those just lambed,
sheep that have been shut up and denied proper exercise in winter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>those on poor feeding and perhaps nursing twins, those that have
suffered from any debilitating disease of any kind are especially
obnoxious to a dangerous attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> The microbe, which Lignieres found in the
pulmonary lesions, is one of the colon group of pathogenic bacteria
that have been classed together as <i>pasteurella</i>. It usually
appears as a very minute ovoid bacillus which stains promptly
and deeply at the poles in fuchsine or gentian violet, leaving a
clear median part, so that it seems a <i>diplococcus</i>. It bleaches
readily in Gram’s solution. Its form varies in different culture
media sometimes showing long <i>bacilli</i>, and sometimes <i>streptococco-bacilli</i>,
but the usual and characteristic appearance is that of
a <i>cocco-bacillus</i>, and to this it constantly returns. The microbe is
ærobic and nonmotile (the slow zig-zag motion sometimes seen
does not seem to be automatic). In peptonised bouillon it produces
opacity in 18 hours, or in simple bouillon in 24 to 48 hours, the best
temperature being 100° F. Gelatine plate cultures are slow
because of the compulsory low temperature, yet in 36 to 48 hours
it forms pale blue, translucent, round colonies the size of a pin
head. It never liquefies. In coagulated blood serum it forms
only a thin transparent pellicle hardly visible, and there is no
growth on potato.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms: Chronic Form.</i> In Argentina, Lignieres observed
the disease especially during the hot summer months (December
to May), and after weaning in the lambs. This may be from the
marked change of food, from the greater activity of microbian
life at this season, from the exhausting effect of the heat, or
from a combination of two or more of these conditions. It
appears alike in the sheepfold, and on the open prairie.
In considerable flocks the symptoms may be at first overlooked,
so that the death of several sheep may be the first
thing to draw attention. Then a certain number are found to
scour, arch the back, walk stiffly, lose condition, and have the
wool flattened and devoid of yolk (<i>clapped</i> wool). The sheep
may be dull, lagging behind its fellows, or lying apart by itself,
ruminating infrequently and for shorter periods than natural, and
there may be inappetence, or depraved appetite (eating earth),
though some eat well to the end. Irregular and at intervals capricious
appetite is a frequent condition. When caught and examined,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the wool is easily torn out, the muscles are soft and wasted,
(the leg muscles may have practically disappeared), the bones stand
out at all points, the skin is pale, thin, bloodless and devoid of its
subcutaneous fat, (paper skin), there may be œdemas along the ventral
aspect of the body, pitting on pressure, and between the
branches of the lower jaw (poked), the eyes are sunken, the conjunctiva
may be puffy and œdematous, but like the muzzle and mouth
they are pale and anæmic and the pulse is small, though the
excitement may have roused cardiac palpitations. The temperature
varies from time to time often reaching 105° or 106° F.
There is liable to be a muco-purulent discharge from nose and
mouth especially noticeable during drinking. As the disease
advances the subject becomes weak, paretic, dull and stupid,
it remains down without interest enough to seek food, though
still eating if it is brought to it. The head is usually rested
on the flank, and the animal often lies so for days in a state
of semi-stupor without disposition or ability to rise, paretic
or paraplegic. Auscultation may sometimes detect a mucous
râle or crepitus, and percussion a flatness of sound over some
part of the lung. Chronic arthritis is an occasional symptom.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> The symptoms closely resemble those of distomatosis
or strongylosis, and the disease is often complicated with
one or more of these, so that it may become difficult to judge
how much is due to the microbian infection and how much to the
helminthiasis. The presence, continuously or intermittently, of
the hyperthermia is almost pathognomonic of the operation of the
microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Acute Form.</i> This has been particularly observed in the ewe
just after lambing, when the system is especially susceptible to
microbian invasion, and little able to cope with it. There are hot
ears, nose and feet, temperature of 104° to 106° F., accelerated
pulse and breathing, anorexia, ardent thirst, deeply congested
mucosæ, colicy pains, pawing the ground, frothy or bloody diarrhœa,
arched back, pendent head, ears and eyelids, muscular
trembling, albuminous urine, plaintive cries, dark red vaginal
discharge, muco-purulent or glairy nasal discharge, and death in
24 to 36 hours. Such animals may be in fair condition or even
fat, no time having been allowed for emaciation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>In other cases death may be delayed for three or four weeks,
with the same general symptoms, only less marked. In such
cases, pregnant ewes are likely to abort, and the lambs are born
dead, or prove weak and listless, and die when a few days old.
Some have too little energy to suck; others suck heartily but perish
all the same on the second or third day, after diarrhœa, thirst,
hyperthermia, prostration, and stupor.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> These vary according to the type. In the <i>rapidly
fatal cases</i> there is dark colored blood, with congestion of the
serous and mucous membranes, which, together with the skin and
often the solid tissues, are covered with petechiæ, and even circumscribed
hæmorrhages. The lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen,
and many of the lymph glands are congested and swollen, seeming
at times of a black hue as if blood-saturated. The lesions,
indeed, indicate an acute septicæmia.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>cases that have survived three or four weeks</i>, the morbid
changes are slighter, the blood is brighter in tint, and the congestions
less deep in color, ecchymoses may be especially confined
to the heart, abomasum and small intestines, which may also show
hæmorrhages. Enlargement and congestion of the lymph glands
are the rule, while pulmonary consolidation and gastro-intestinal
mucous inflammations are frequently found. As in the more
acute types the urine is albuminous.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>chronic cases</i> the anæmia is prominent. The clot is soft, relatively
small, elastic and black, the serum is relatively very abundant
and pale. The red globules are greatly reduced in numbers,
and there are a number of giant cells which stain deeply as in
chlorosis. The lymph glands are usually enlarged, softened and
slightly congested but rarely the seat of blood extravasation. The
tissues generally are pallid, soft and shrunken. There is a
marked absence of subcutaneous and intermuscular fat, while the
connective tissue is more or less infiltrated with a transparent,
watery lymph. The serous cavities usually contain more than the
normal amount of fluid, transparent or straw-colored, and with
few globules or granules. Congestions and even shreds of false
membrane are sometimes present on the serosa. In some cases
the lungs and bronchia are the seat of inflammatory exudates,
causing nodular consolidations of from one-half to one inch in
diameter. Not unfrequently the lungs show strongylosis as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>fourth stomach shows strongylus contortus, the small intestines
strongylus filicollis, tæniae (expansa, fimbriata, etc.), the large
intestines æsophagostoma Columbiana, and tricocephalus affinis,
and the gall ducts distoma hepaticum and distoma lanceolatum.
In these chronic cases the spleen is usually shrunken, and the
liver firm, sometimes even cirrhotic.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality.</i> The acute cases are usually fatal. Those that assume
a chronic form, if free from local lesions in important organs,
well-fed, and, above all, kept in the open air, and changed to a
different pasture, tend largely to recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> The propagation of the infection from animal to
animal is slow and somewhat uncertain, and when introduced by
the purchase of a new ram or other animal, it may take a considerable
time to affect the stock extensively, but for this reason,
and because an apparently sound sheep may harbor the germ, it
is difficult to oppose it successfully by segregation. All the same,
it is desirable to take all possible precautions against its advent,
and among these, the exclusion of strange sheep from noninfected
pastures and flocks. When the time comes to make an outcross
from the home strain, the ram must be selected not only for his
pedigree and individual qualities, but no less for the soundness
of the flock from which he is taken. If the lambs of that flock
have been decimated by disease, the best blue blood, and most
faultless form should not tempt the flockmaster. He should be
rejected in favor of one taken from a flock that is above suspicion.
It matters little if it can be plausibly argued that the mortality
came from worms of the lungs, liver, or digestive organs; these
in themselves may soon ruin any flock, but they, too, often coexist
with the microbe of infectious septicæmia, and, when this
is the case, they prepare the system and open a way for its invasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>New purchases should not only be selected from apparently
sound and guaranteed stock, but they should be passed through
an antiseptic dip on arrival, and then if possible quarantined in a
special enclosure until they shall have proved their freedom from
infection. A valuable ram may be placed with some lambs or
yearlings in close quarters to ascertain whether he has brought
the infecting matter with him. If all escape after some months
the presumption is that he is sound. Perfect cleanliness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>fold should be maintained, and disinfectants may be freely used
in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The water supplies should be watched, rejecting streams that
have drained sheep-pastures where there have been marked losses
of lambs and ewes. Water from deep wells without any surface
leakage is to be preferred.</p>

<p class='c008'>When new stock (ram, ewes, lambs) are of necessity mixed
with the sound herd, a wide range, an open air life, and abundant
dietary must be secured. The system that is full of strength and
vigor can better resist the microbe and even throw it off entirely,
whereas the weak, confined subject succumbs. For the same
reason, the weak, emaciated and debilitated subjects should be at
once separated from the sound flock, and kept in a special enclosure,
in the open air, on a rich diet. Should they harbor worms,
this seclusion is even more imperative. (See parasites of lungs,
liver, stomach and bowels).</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres advocates immunization by serum prepared on the
Pasteur method, but, as he has not divulged the exact technique
of its preparation, it is impossible as yet, to give this an unqualified
endorsement. It has this in its favor that the mature sheep,
in full vigor of middle life, though in an infected area, usually
resist the infection, while the young, old, debilitated and verminous
suffer. Opposed to it are these considerations that are recognized
by Lignieres himself;—1st, The acquired immunity is not
perfect, as shown by occasional relapses in sheep that have survived
a first attack; 2d, The serum inoculation is not only useless,
but dangerous in animals that already harbor the germ; I
may, add 3d, Any acquired parasitism or debilitating disease may
tend to break down the immunity and prostrate the system under
the infection. Lignieres advises that the serum treatment should
be restricted to the new born lambs in infected herds, or herds in
infected areas. The first three or four weeks after birth are to
be preferred for the operation, though failing this it may still be
ventured on, up to a few days before weaning. The longer it is
delayed the greater the danger of a preëxisting infection, and of
untoward results from the new access of infecting material, on
the back of an infection which varies so extremely in its pathogenic
potency. Even among the new born lambs, Lignieres
would restrict the serum therapy to the strong, robust and healthy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and, if they survive the resulting fever, would repeat the <i>treatment</i>
after the hyperthermia has ceased. No satisfactory treatment
of the disease has been made. An open air life, a generous
diet, and a course of iron, and bitters will, however, be of use in
serving to improve health, digestion and vigor, to solicit a better
production of red globules, and to enable the patient to survive
the period of anæmia, prostration and debility. Antiseptics like
quinia, the sulphites and the iodides might be used as adjuncts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the different forms of hæmorrhagic septicæmia in sheep,
that observed by Galtier in 1889 in Basses Alpes, and later elsewhere
in southern and western France and in Algiers, must be
specially noted. It seems to be the same affection studied later
by Lienaux, Conte, Besnoit and Cuillé and which prevailed from
Tarn in the south of France, to Vendée in the west, and Somme
in the north.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> The pathogenic factor found in the lesions was
an ovoid bacterium, a little larger than that of fowl cholera, motile,
non-liquefying, with polar staining, and often showing in
short chains of two or three joined end to end. It grows easily
and abundantly in all common culture media, even on potato
which fails to propagate the cocco-bacillus of Lignieres. This,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>with its ready transmission from swine to sheep and <i>vice versa</i>,
apparently serves to differentiate it from the cocco-bacillus, and
the disease from the hæmorrhagic septicæmia of Lignieres.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathogenesis.</i> In Galtier’s first observations in Basses Alpes
four separate flocks were infected by pigs brought all from one
market, and placed in or by the pens of the sheep where they
sickened and one in seven died in a few days. Then the mortality
began among the sheep and ranged as follows: 1st flock lost 10
in 37: 2d flock 16 in 25: 3d flock 8 in 20: 4th flock 12 in 22.
On one farm 10 sheep were sent to a neighbor’s just before the
arrival of the sick pigs and escaped, and on another a second
flock kept in outlying pens well apart from the home flock kept
perfectly sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>With cultures of the microbe in vitro, he successfully inoculated
sheep, goats, dogs, chickens, Guinea pigs, rabbits, and, finally,
a calf and an ass. The cultures were inoculated in different cases;
intravenously, into the trachea, pleura, lung, and subcutaneous
connective tissue, and one goat was infected by ingestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres claims that Galtier must have worked with a complex
infection in which his (Lignieres’) cocco-bacillus was an essential
constituent. The evidence of this is, however, lacking, and we
must recognize that Galtier made cultures which showed the close
relationship of his organisms to swine plague, and their lack of
complete identity with those of the Lombriz.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lienaux and Conte had pathogenic results in a limited number
of animals only (rabbit, mouse, Guinea pig) illustrating the familiar
truth of the variability in the pathogenesis of different
specimens of septicæmic bacteria of the colon group.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> 1. <i>Acute Form.</i> There is a sudden marked rise
of temperature, often to 107° F., with acceleration of pulse and
respiration. Sometimes death follows so early as to prevent the
observation of other symptoms. If otherwise there supervene
marked dulness, prostration, somnolence, anorexia, suspension of
rumination, and more or less tympany of the rumen. The
patient is found lying down, apart from the flock, indisposed to
rise, with deep red, congested, arborescent conjunctiva and other
mucous membranes, and petechial spots on these and on the white
portions of the skin. The fæces, at first moderately firm and
moulded in pellets, marked here and there with lines of mucus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>or even blood, become on the second or third day soft, pultaceous,
or watery and highly offensive. Parallel with this, emaciation
advances with rapid strides. Breathing becomes more hurried,
wheezing or snuffling, with a muco-serous, often bloody discharge
from the nose, and an infrequent cough. Careful auscultation
and percussion will often reveal the blowing or mucous râles, the
crepitation or flatness on percussion of broncho-pneumonia. As
the disease advances the petechiæ on skin and mucosæ extend,
and extensive deep violet areas show especially on the inner sides
of the arms and thighs, on the under surface of the tail, on the
perineum and under the belly. Abortion is a common result, the
lambs coming dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Death may occur in six hours, more commonly in two or three
days, or even longer, the temperature going down to below normal
in the last stages. In case of recovery, convalescence is slow,
the animal remaining emaciated and weak, with lung lesions and
persistent cough for a length of time. These poor imperfectly
recovered animals continue to harbor the microbe and transmit it.
Lesions of the liver and other organs, the result of this disease,
are found in sheep that have survived the affection and are afterward
killed for mutton.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms: 2. Subacute and Chronic Form.</i> This is seen in
mature sheep of two or three years, that have been infected when
in the full vigor of life and health, during an open air life and by
a limited dose of the virus. The temperature is less elevated, the
circulatory and respiratory functions less disturbed, the dulness
and prostration only moderate, the interruption of feeding and
rumination transient and tympany slight. Cough and nasal discharge
are however present and rather persistent, diarrhœa may
be manifested, and marked emaciation occurs. There may be
congestion of the mucosæ, but petechiæ and extensive bloody discoloration
of the mucous membranes or skin are rarely seen.
Abortion is not uncommon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Recoveries are the rule in this type of the disease, though in
some cases it will be delayed for weeks and may even then be imperfect.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> In the acute types of the disease decomposition advances
rapidly after death, and the carcass from the first exhales
a peculiarly heavy odor. The skin is discolored, the nasal mucosa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>is the seat of a muco-purulent or sanguinolent discharge, the
anus is soiled with liquid fæces, the subcutaneous connective
tissue marked by red arborescence and blood-stained areas, or by
a gelatinoid exudation, the muscles at times deeply colored and
petechiated, the lymph glands, especially the bronchial and mesenteric,
are enlarged and congested of a deep red—the color being
highest in the cortical zone. In some old standing cases these
may have softened and acquired a grayish hue. They are rich
in the specific bacterium.</p>

<p class='c008'>The peritoneum is congested, petechiated, thickened, and more
or less covered with thin false membranes, and it contains from a
pint to three quarts of a sero-sanguinolent liquid which coagulates
loosely on exposure. The liver is congested, with points of blood
extravasation, and zones of degeneration (fibroid, fatty or necrotic),
and sometimes abscess. The congestion extends to the
spleen and pancreas. The abomasum and intestines are the seat
of mucous gastro-enteritis. The mucous folds of the pyloric sac
of the stomach are congested, reddened and petechiated, the small
intestine has tracts and patches of congestion, thickening and softening,
Peyers’ patches and the solitary glands are enlarged, and
ulcers may be present on large or small intestines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Effusion is usually found in the pleura, clear, grayish or bloody,
with flocculi and false membranes, and further branching redness
of the serosa. The mediastinum may be thickened by exudate
especially around the glands, œsophagus and blood vessels. The
lung shows lobular, interlobular and peribronchial exudates approaching
at times to the appearances shown in lung plague,
along with the atelectasis, emphysema and, in prolonged cases,
caseation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Less constant are congestions and petechiæ of the pericardium,
heart, kidneys, vesical mucosa, testicles, ovaries or womb. The
blood is dark and forms a loose coagulum. In case of abortion
the umbilical cord is infiltrated and the placental membranes
ecchymotic. The brain and spinal cord and their membranes are
sometimes congested and infiltrated and a serous effusion exists
in the arachnoid.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacterium is found more or less abundantly in each of the
morbid lesions.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> Absolute seclusion of the sick and of all their
products is the prime essential. The general distribution of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>lesions throughout the body and the uniform presence of the
bacterium in the lesions indicate that no part of the body and no
secretion can be considered as free from infection. All parts
of the body, all expectoration, saliva, fæces, urine, milk even must
be withheld from all other animals, at least until they have been
thoroughly cooked or disinfected. Manure must be burned, or
buried deeply in quicklime. Contaminated pens, yards, wallows,
streams and fields must be abandoned or thoroughly disinfected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Galtier found that the virus remained active for six days in
putrefying organic matter at 39° to 75° F.; in 25 days in water,
at room temperature; the refuse litter, fodder, manure, and drainage
matter from the infected place must be carefully guarded
against. The virus steadily loses in force in such media, but
remains infecting to animals injected with it. The most active
disinfectants may be used on the pens and yards (copperas 5%,
sulphuric acid 2% solution, or mercuric chloride .2%) while the contaminated
fields should be abandoned for the season. All droppings
may be treated with sulphuric acid (2%), creolin, lysol,
phenic acid or copper sulphate. The susceptibility of practically
all the animals of the farm, demands the exclusion of these, while
that of rodents, renders necessary the further exclusion of wild
mammals; and we may add birds, wild and tame, and if possible
flies. The plowing of the contaminated soil will do much to obviate
danger, yet the sheep folds and pastures should be separated by a
considerable distance from any place where infected animals and
objects have been. If drinking troughs for sound animals have
been used by the sick or suspected they should be emptied and
washed with a disinfectant (sulphuric acid 2:100).</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ULCERATIVE (ERYSIPELATOID) INFECTION OF THE LIMBS IN CATTLE AND SHEEP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>New York outbreaks. Causes: wounds by sharp pebbles, streptococci,
pure cultures, inoculations. Symptoms: swelling on lower limbs, abscesses,
implicating tendons, bones, joints, and under hoof. Prevention: avoid
septic or frosted mud, irritants, etc., disinfect surface, keep dry and clean,
open abscesses, use disinfectants, separate infected.</p>

<p class='c007'>This affection was seen in several herds in Oneida Co., N. Y.,
in the Spring of 1897. The geological formation of the region
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>was a calcareous rock with a surface soil thickly impregnated with
pebbles and small flat shaly masses. Sheep suffered in Western
New York.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> In Oneida, the subjects were dairy cows, which in
the early spring, when the frost went out of the ground, had to
wade through chilly soft mud reaching to the knees or above, and
mixed with small stones with sharp edges, and with semiliquid
manurial products. The abrasions made by these stones furnished
convenient infection atria for septic microbes in the manure. In
the pus obtained from the ulcers were found in abundance the
bacillus coli commune, and a long streptococcus representing on an
average from 20 to 40 cocci in a chain. Dr. Moore made pure
cultures of these and produced the same symptoms in a cow by
injecting the streptococcus subcutaneously in the back of the
pastern, and in another animal by simply abrading the surface
and rubbing on the streptococcus culture. As the inflammation,
suppuration, and resulting ulcers implicated not only the skin
but also the subcutaneous connective tissue, the affection had
many of the characters of erysipelas.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The affection commenced by swelling in the region
of the fetlock, pastern, metacarpus or metatarsus, and exceptionally,
the forearm or tibial region, and advanced to a tense swelling,
which pitted on pressure, and the formation of centres of suppuration,
which burst and discharged. If the exposure to the septic
mud were continued the sores ulcerated and extended both in the
skin and subcutaneous connective tissue, but when the dry
weather came and the mud disappeared, the tendency was to
spontaneous recovery. In some instances ulceration extended
beneath the hoof threatening its evulsion, and in other cases it
extended deeply to the tendons and ligaments.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> The main object should be prevention, to be
secured by protecting the stock against contact with septic mud,
and especially such as is near the freezing point and intermixed
with such sharp stones and pebbles as would wound the surface
and open channels for infection. When infection has taken place
we should seek to limit it by lotions of an antiseptic character.
Bandages soaked in a solution of hyposulphite of sodium, 1 dr. to
the ounce will often succeed. A more potent application is
iodized phenol, prepared as follows: tincture of iodine 2 drs.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>carbolic acid crystals 4 drs., glycerine 1 oz., alcohol 1 oz., water
8 ozs. When applied on a bandage this may be diluted with
water to make 1 pint. For circumscribed application to forming
sores the undiluted iodized phenol, made of one part each of
iodine and carbolic acid crystals, may be applied twice a day with
a glass rod. Other favorite applications are a lotion of lead and
laudanum; a saturated solution of boric acid; ninety-five per
cent. alcohol; a mixture of creolin 1 part, iodoform 4 parts, and
lanolin 10 parts; ichthyol and collodion; ichthyol and vaseline;
or iodol, iodoform, salicylic acid or resorcin as dusting powders.</p>

<p class='c008'>Internally, tincture of muriate of iron 3 drms. every three
hours helps to keep the affection in check.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>GANGRENOUS INFECTION OF THE CORONET. HORSE. POTCHETCHOUI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Seen on rich, damp lands. Symptoms: lameness, small areas of congestion,
erection of hairs, vesiculation, pustulation, gangrene as deep as tendons,
depilation, desquamation, fistulæ, slough of hoof, early fever, impaired
appetite, recovery in 14 to 21 days in most cases. Staphylococcus
and streptococcus. Prevention: segregation, different attendants, avoidance
of infecting land while damp, smear limbs with antiseptics. Treatment:
antiseptic bandages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under this name Sotsevich describes an infectious disease of the
horse, which prevails in the Don province, and especially on rich,
low, damp lands. Before the appearance of any local lesion, the
horse goes very lame on one limb. Afterward there appears,
usually on the coronet or pastern, an area on which the hairs
stand erect, with elevation of the epidermis and the formation of
vesicles as large as barley corns, filled with a yellowish white
liquid and later with pus. Gangrene follows, extending from the
skin to the subcutaneous connective tissue, aponeurosis and tendons,
and forming large sores, one to two inches in diameter and
discharging an abundant yellow, fœtid pus. The adjacent skin
takes on a yellow tint and sheds its hair and epidermis. The disease
may extend into the interphalangean joints or under the
hoof, leading to offensive fistulæ or evulsion of the hoof. If it
extends to the higher parts of the limb it becomes less destructive.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>At the onset there is some fever (101° F.), dulness and inappetence,
but these gradually subside, and in favorable cases complete
recovery has taken place in two or three weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bacteriological investigation has detected in the contents of the
vesicles, staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention</i> is largely secured by a rigid separation of the diseased
from the healthy. Other obvious precautions would be to
exclude those dressing the sores from handling other horses until
after thorough disinfection of the hands, and to keep the sound
animals, during wet seasons, from the damp infecting soils, or
when they must work on these, to smear the lower parts of the
limbs with antiseptic ointments (tar, carbolic, iodine, mercuric,
etc., etc.)</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> with sublimate bandages proves very satisfactory,
yet any comparatively non-irritating antiseptic lotion may be used.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Distemper; Coryza Contagiosa Equorum; Gourme
(Fr.); Druse (Ger.); Cimurro (Ital.).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An infective, streptococcic, febrile disease of solipeds,
usually manifested by a catarrhal inflammation of the upper
air passages, and phlegmon of the adjacent lymph glands, or less
frequently by phlegmonous inflammation of lymph glands elsewhere
or of the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Historic Notes.</i> Strangles was fairly indicated in the writings
of the ancient Greek veterinarians, and was clearly described and
attributed to contagion by Solleysel in 1664. It was so evidently
infectious that it was experimentally inoculated by Lafosse in
1790, by Viborg, in 1802, and later, by Erdelyi (1813) and
Toggia (1823) and others. Rivolta, in 1873, found a streptococcus
in the pus of its abscesses, and to this the contagion was
definitely assigned by Baruchello (1887), Schütz, Sand and Jensen
(1888). Priority in this demonstration is accorded to Schütz.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> The <i>streptococcus coryzæ contagiosæ Equi</i> (Streptococcus
rhino-adenitis or S. equi) is easily found in the pus of
gland abscesses sometimes in pure cultures (impure in the nasal
discharge), stains readily in aniline colors and in Gram’s solution
so that it stands out clearly among the pus cells. The decolorizing
agent must be weak (not muriatic acid) and applied only for a
very short time. Beside the chain forms, there are isolated, oval
cocci, some of which, larger than others and more elongated,
have been held to be arthrospores or mother cells. The number
of elements articulated in a chain varies from two to four and upward.
The chains are straight or sinuous, and may be grouped
in bundles, radiating masses, or clumps like staphylococci.</p>

<p class='c008'>They are ærobic (facultative anærobic), grow freely as transparent
droplets on blood serum at 99° F., and in glycerine bouillon,
and less vigorously on agar and gelatine. On agar the colonies
reach the size of a pin head in two days with projecting alæ, and
on gelatine in three to five days, and then dry and shrink. Multiplication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>takes place by transverse division, and at such a time
the organism may seem to be a chain of diplococci.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathogenesis.</i> Inoculation of cultures on a susceptible horse
produces the unquestionable phenomena of strangles, and solipeds
alone take the disease casually. In white mice it produces
abscess in the seat of puncture and in the adjacent lymph glands.
If the action is delayed the abscess may be in lung, spleen, kidneys,
liver, or other distant organ. Rabbits, Guinea pigs, pigeons,
pigs and cattle are immune unless large doses are employed. Intravenously
large doses kill the lamb.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>identity</i> of the microbe with other streptococci of animals
and man has been claimed. Arloing alleges that, by culture of
the microbe in the blood or peritoneum of the live rabbit, he
exalted the virulence, and obtained in succession a streptococcus
capable of producing <i>erysipelas</i>; <i>gangrenous erysipelas</i>; <i>suppurating</i>,
<i>sloughing erysipelas</i>; <i>pseudo-membranous peritonitis</i>; <i>metastatic
abscesses</i>; and <i>fulminant septic peritonitis</i>. Hill, Jensen
and Sand, and Lignieres, as the result of cultures and inoculations
claim that strangles streptococcus is identical with that of contagious
pneumonia. Courmont, on the other hand, as the result
of his cultures and inoculations, concludes that the microbe of
strangles and that of erysipelas are independent organisms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The clinical evidence is decidedly against the theory of identity.
In epizoötics of strangles we meet with a constant succession of
cases of strangles and in districts into which contagious pneumonia
has never been introduced, no single case of that disease
ever comes in to break the monotony of the sequence and to start
a series of cases of the latter affection. Conversely, in an outbreak
of contagious pneumonia in a locality heretofore free from
strangles, strangles do not develop. Again, no matter how
prevalent nor how constant strangles may be in a locality, and
how habitually men have their wounded hands covered with
the pus of the abscesses, no epidemic of erysipelas is entailed in
man. Strangles spreads with remarkable rapidity through a
stable, but not to the often more than equally exposed human attendants,
nor to any animal apart from the genus equus. The
absence of strangles from Iceland (Jonsson) endorses that view.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a practical question of sanitary science, we occupy a sound
position in differentiating the germs of strangles and contagious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>pneumonia, and further that of erysipelas of man, as a wise health
officer would differentiate the microbes of cowpox and smallpox.
Whatever may be true or false as to their primary identity, or as
to the transition of one to the other in successive inoculations on
animals of other genera, they are essentially diverse pathogenically
as we meet with them in practice, and our measures may be
safely based on this practical diversity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> <i>Youth</i> strongly predisposes, most cases
occurring between two and five years, and seventy per cent. before
five years. It may, however, appear at any age, being congenital
in some cases (Nocard, etc.), in others appearing a few weeks after
birth, and in still others at over twenty years, if the subjects have
not contracted it earlier.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dentition</i> which is active in these early years, induces congestion
about the head and general constitutional disturbance, which
make the system more receptive.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Training</i> or <i>breaking</i> is another reason for the predisposition
in the young. The first experience of the <i>hot, impure, infected
air</i> of the stable, the unwonted <i>grain feeding</i>, the <i>excitements</i> and
<i>perspirations</i> attendant on the first handling all contribute to
temporary loss of resistance.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fatigue</i> like other weakening conditions lays the system open
to attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Chill</i> is a most efficient cause, hence the disease often prevails
most extensively in spring and autumn, at the time of changing
the coat, and of passing from stable to field and the converse.
Joly relates that in Russia where large numbers die of strangles
through imperfect stabling in winter, immunity is sought through
a milder first attack, brought on in the milder autumn weather by
turning the young animals into a deep pool for half an hour and
then exposing them freely to cold winds and giving cold water to
drink. The omnipresent germ takes occasion to attack the cold
debilitated system.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any <i>change of latitude</i> or of locality acts in the same way.
Riquet even alleges that this will bring about a second and even
a third attack. It is common, he says, for newly bought young
horses to have the disease at Hamburg, and after recovery to have
a second attack at Hanover and finally a third one after they join
the regiments in France. A similar exhaustion of immunity has
been repeatedly noticed in the case of canine distemper.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span><i>Horse trading</i> and the <i>stabling of large numbers</i> together is
naturally the most fruitful of infection and hence strangles is a
virtual plague in dealers’ studs. The buildings in such cases are
reinfected at short intervals with virulent types of the streptococcus,
and fresh susceptible animals are being constantly introduced
to keep it up. Riquet says that in Northern Germany
dealers avoid this largely by traveling their purchases in bands of
100 or 150 head, from ten to twelve miles a day, feeding sparingly,
and turning them like sheep into an open park at night
regardless of the weather. Much of the advantage is doubtless
from the avoidance of stable infection and the warm relaxing air
of indoors.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>A sea voyage</i> especially favors infection and a single victim
placed on board will speedily contaminate all susceptible animals
present.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally the predisposing influence of <i>catarrh of the air-passages</i>
must not be overlooked. The inflamed mucosa furnishes a most
inviting infection entrance.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Infecting products.</i> The streptococcus abounds in the local
phlegmons and abscesses, in the exudate of the submaxillary,
pharyngeal or other glandular swellings, in the pustular eruption
on the skin, and in the catarrhal discharge from the air passages.
It further exists in the alimentary canal, in the ingesta and in the
blood to a limited extent. In the bowels of an immunized animal
it may remain virulent for months. Thus it comes that the manure
is a source of infection, and that soiled fodder, litter and
water may prove dangerous. The infected soil can not only
harbor but can multiply the microbe, keeping it in readiness to
attack any receptive horse. On his part the horse that is immune
and in vigorous health may carry the infection for months
and transmit it to his less resistant fellow.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the streptococcus is usually found in the blood, in limited
numbers only, its presence there implies its general diffusion
and especially in the lymph plexuses and glands. Hence, the
danger of operations on the subjects of strangles, the weakened
tissues of the wound forming a most inviting field of growth.
Castrations, occurring as they do mostly in the growing animal,
are especially to be guarded against, and I may cite the case,
familiar to many, in which seven cryptorchids died with phlegmon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>in the seat of the wound, the first one operated on having
had strangles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nasal and buccal discharges are especially liable to convey
the infection through mangers, racks, fodders, drinking troughs
and pails, harness, poles and shafts, halters, twitches and the like.
Infection through blankets, brushes, rubbers, and the clothes and
hands of attendants, dealers, veterinarians and others, is not
to be overlooked.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathology.</i> The streptococcus shows a special disposition to
enter and advance along the lines of the lymphatic circulation.
The paucity of the germ in the blood and its abundance in the
lymph plexuses, vessels and glands show that its election is preëminently
for the lymphatic system. Then the ordinary primary
lesions in and around the upper part of the air passage (nose,
pharynx, submaxillary, parotidean and pharyngeal lymph glands)
bespeak infection by inhalation, rather than with the ingesta. Primary
solitary lesions on or near stomach or intestine are almost
unknown; nearly all such being secondary. Next to inhalation,
the most prominent channel of entrance is through castration and
other wounds. Abrasions and sores of skin diseases must rank
after wounds as entrance channels. Transmission by copulation
the microbe being lodged on the genital mucosa is well established,
also transmission from mother to fœtus through the placenta,
and from dam to offspring through the milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the most familiar type of the disease the nasal mucosa is red,
congested and somewhat thickened with exudate, and the epithelium
is softened and desquamating. As the result of this desquamation
there may be slight abrasions or raw sores but these
do not show indications of the irregular outline, excavations, or
progressive extensions that characterize the ulcers of glanders.
The surface is usually plentifully covered with a muco-purulent
material with less disposition to adhesiveness than in glanders.
It is rare to see any exudate into, and thickening of the walls of
the lymphatics running from the nostrils toward the submaxillary
glands. The predominance of the streptococcus in, and the entire
absence of the glanders bacillus from the discharge and inflamed
mucosa are conclusive. In the regular cases in which the submaxillary
lymph glands are implicated, both right and left are
usually involved, though not to the same degree, the exudate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>fills not only the gland tissue, but a large amount of the surrounding
connective tissue as well, there is a great accumulation
of lymphoid cells, and more or less extensive pus cavities, containing
usually a white, creamy product. In the early stages the
glands may be hard and nodular, as in glanders, but this condition
is very transient, so that the rule is to find an extensive surrounding
exudation filling up the whole intermaxillary space, and having a
great abundance of small round cells with double or triple nuclei.
In the older cases there is usually the open abscess, and if the
case is an indolent one there may be extensive organization of
the exudate with formation of dense, fibrous tissue. In some
instances the nasal sinuses are filled with muco-pus.</p>

<p class='c008'>When lesions extend farther implicating the pharynx and
larynx, the mucosa of these parts shows the same redness, congestion,
cloudy swelling and desquamation with, in some instances,
small, submucous abscesses, and in others extensive infiltration
of the submucosa with lymph so as to narrow or even
close the lumen of the larynx. The guttural pouches may be
filled with pus though this is far from constant. The pharyngeal
lymph glands, are nearly always involved and often the lymph gland
in the parotid so that a general infiltration of the surrounding
parts is met with.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the chest is implicated there is congestion of the bronchial
mucosa, engorgement of the smaller bronchia, air sacs and cells
with pus, collapse, carnification or congestion of lobules, in some
cases pulmonary abscess, and, finally, swelling and not infrequently
abscess of the bronchial glands. Pleurisy is a not uncommon
accompaniment, appearing it may be as a simple extension,
from the lung, or, in the worst forms, from rupture of mediastinal
or glandular abscesses into the cavity and severe infection
of the entire pleural walls. The pericardium is exceptionally
involved and coagula on the tricuspid valves have been met with
(Zschokke).</p>

<p class='c008'>Circumscribed phlegmonous exudates and small abscesses are
sometimes found in the mouth (tongue, soft palate, cheeks) and
less frequently in the œsophagus.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stomach may show congestions, petechiæ, circumscribed
hæmorrhages, ulcers, and abscesses of the gland tissue or submucosa.
Rupture of the walls may follow abscess (Cadeac).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>The intestines may show congestions, colorless or hæmorrhagic
exudate, and suppurations in the agminated or solitary glands,
or submucosa. The intestinal, mesenteric and sublumbar lymph
glands may be the centres of abscesses of varying sizes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abscesses may also be found in the liver, pancreas, spleen,
of variable size and usually as secondary formations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The muscles and intermuscular tissue may be the seat of more
or less extensive exudation, and abscess, and the bones may be
congested and swollen especially in their epiphysis. This may
extend to suppuration or necrosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>The synovial membranes of joints and the tendinous sheaths
are not infrequently inflamed causing distension and even suppuration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Congestions of the skin are sometimes met with developing as
multiple papules or hard nodules which advance to the formation
of pustules or small abscesses. These often appear especially
where the skin is thin and delicate as around the lips, nose and
eyes, close to the anus or vulva, in the perineum, sheath or mammæ,
inside the thighs or elbow. They may be of all dimensions
from a millet seed upward, and may merge into or become complicated
by the extensive engorgements of petechial fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally lesions of the nerve centres are to be looked for in the
protracted or irregular types of the disease. There may be simple
congestion, or serous effusion, intraventricular or subarachnoid,
or finally abscess in the brain, spinal cord or meninges.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Forms of Strangles.</i> The types of strangles vary, special forms
characterizing given epizoötics or seasons, or at other times as
individual deviations from the current type. Division has been
made into two groups—<i>mild</i> and <i>malignant</i>, or again into <i>regular</i>
and <i>irregular</i>, under each of which come several varieties. Many
of these varieties consist simply in a difference in the seat of the
principle lesions, which start in lymph glands or tissues at a distance
from the nasal mucosa, or they depend on secondary foci of
infection supervening on the primary disease in the head.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> In inoculated cases this lasts from three to five
days, in those due to simple exposure it may appear to extend
over eight days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>General Symptoms.</i> In nearly all cases alike there is a marked
constitutional disturbance the temperature often rising at once to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>104° to 106° F., and oscillating on successive days between this
and 102°; the pulse is usually normal at first and the breathing
is either slightly accelerated or may be made so under slight exertion.
There is more or less dulness, or at least a lack of the
vivacity of youth, the head is somewhat pendent, the eyes may be
semiclosed, the patient may be tardy or even stiff in his movements
and the appetite may be diminished or capricious, oats
being rejected by some and hay or grass by others. The bowels
are somewhat confined, the stools consisting of a few small, hard,
balls covered with mucus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Specific Symptoms in the Mild Form.</i> In the vast majority of
cases the local symptoms are concentrated on the mucosæ of nose
and mouth, and the submaxillary lymph glands. Along with
the general febrile phenomena, there appear redness and often
mottled congestion of the nasal mucosa, which not infrequently
extends to the mouth and eyes, as well. Heat of the mouth, the
collection of a more or less tenacious mucus, and even uneasy
movements of the jaw may be seen. The nasal mucosa, at first
dry, is soon the seat of a watery exudation, passing into a cloudy
sticky material, and finally a thick, opaque, muco-purulent flow.
This may become colored of a variety of tints, dirty white from
inhaled dust, brownish or yellowish from exuded blood, or greenish
from food materials. The discharge is usually profuse in the
young and may be scanty in the old. Most commonly it flows
from both nostrils alike, though exceptionally it is unilateral.
In this it differs from glanders which is more often unilateral
though at times bilateral. Small abrasions and sores may appear
in connection with the softening and shedding of the epithelium,
but these are not ragged, irregular and spreading as in glanders.
Sneezing or snorting is an inevitable symptom. Epiphora is usually
present. Exudations into the nasal sinuses are to be recognized
by heat of the forehead and flat sound on percussion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very early in the attack a swelling is noticed in the intermaxillary
space, which may be at first confined to the nodules of
the lymph glands, thus forming distinct, rounded, hard swellings,
but they are early covered by a diffuse exudation into the surrounding
connective tissue, that completely envelopes and obscures
the form of the swollen glands, and forms a more or less
uniformly rounded, pasty swelling, extending to the median line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of the intermaxillary space, or filling the whole space from one
maxilla to the other and projecting downward below their level.
This early, diffuse, pasty, evenly rounded swelling, hot and tender,
is distinctive of strangles, and usually exclusive of glanders.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another characteristic of the strangles swelling is its steady,
and usually speedy, advance to suppuration and abscess. It becomes
hard, tense, and resistant, then, in the centre, or at various
points of the surface, small areas of circumscribed softening can
be detected, and soon show distinct fluctuation. Two or more of
these may coalesce or they may form several distinct abscesses,
which may early point, burst and discharge, when the remainder
of the exudate softens and degenerates into pus, and the cavity
closes by granulation. In some cases after the formation of the
swelling it disappears by resolution, the exudate becoming liquefied
and absorbed. In glanders the nodular, insensible, swelling
tends to persist without extensive pasty exudation or suppuration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cases of <i>strangles catarrh</i> in which the submaxillary lesions
are omitted, are quite common. These occur during the regular
strangles epizoötic, and protect against a second attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of Pharyngeal and Laryngeal Strangles.</i> Extension
of the morbid process from nose to pharynx is exceedingly
common. When concentrated on the pharynx there are extension
of the head forward with elevation of the nose, swelling of the
throat laterally or downward, uneasy movements of the jaws,
salivation, difficulty of swallowing, return of ingested liquids
through the nose, gulping, and a loose suffocative cough. The
swelling of the throat tends to attain to large dimensions, and
may threaten suffocation by interfering with the breathing. This
is still further aggravated if the laryngeal mucosa is the seat of
exudate. The breathing may become loud and stertorous, the
mucosæ of a dark leaden hue and the animal dull and stupid
from the venous condition of the circulating blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abscesses forming on the lateral parts of the throat usually
make their way to the surface though this may be below the level
of the parotid. If from the parotidean lymph gland, one of the
ducts may be opened thus forming a salivary fistula. If from
the retro- (supra-) pharyngeal glands the rupture into the
pharynx is more likely to take place, but in some cases the investing
sac, meeting with equal resistance in all directions, fails
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>to undergo degeneration and softening at any one particular point,
and the contents remain pent up indefinitely. If the liquid is
absorbed a cheesy or putty like mass may be the final outcome,
with chronic cough, some stertor in breathing and it may be
difficulty in swallowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the guttural pouches should be involved, there is deafness,
parotidean swelling, which may eventuate in a fluctuating swelling
at the lower border of the parotid, and a free discharge when
the head is lowered, which is likely to last after general recovery.
(See Guttural Pouches, pus in).</p>

<p class='c008'>Laryngeal paralysis and roaring often follow laryngitis in
strangles.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pulmonary Symptoms in Strangles.</i> <i>Tracheitis</i> and <i>bronchitis</i>
are forms of extension of strangles from the upper air passages,
and <i>pneumonia</i> follows of virtual necessity. In many cases these
are primarily dependent on the descent into the lungs of the infecting
discharges, complicated in many cases by the inhalation
of food materials. There are the usual symptoms of broncho-pneumonia
complicating those of strangles and the percussion and
auscultation signs usually imply circumscribed areas of congestion
and consolidation with intervening areas of pervious lung. There
may be at such points the blowing or mucous râles of bronchitis,
the sibilant sounds of emphysema, the crepitation of congestion
and the abnormal clearness of sounds carried from distant organs
through the consolidated lung. On percussion there may be the
non-resonance of the consolidated areas, and the excess of resonance
over emphysematous portions or open gas-filled vomicæ.
In these last cases there may be an amphoric sound on auscultation
and a crack-pot sound on percussion. These pulmonary
lesions are often fatal, or the recovery is slow on account of a
succession of lobular congestions and abscesses.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Abdominal Symptoms in Strangles.</i> The abdominal lesions in
strangles are usually secondary, the infection reaching the part
through the blood, or by the lymphatics from a castration or
other wound, or from infection by coitus. The phlegmon and
abscess may be in the mucosa, especially in the agminated or
solitary glands, in the adjacent lymph glands at the connection
with the mesentery and in those of the mesentery itself. The
animal is dull, listless, with dry, staring coat, tympany and slight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>colicy pains after eating, costiveness, retracted, tender abdomen,
insensible loins, and groaning when rising, when walking down
a steep incline, or turning in a very narrow circle. These symptoms
following an apparent or partial recovery from strangles are
significant, and rectal examination may detect a hard, tender
mass connected with the bowel or mesentery.</p>

<p class='c008'>If rupture takes place into the peritoneum there is general infective
inflammation of that structure with sudden access of fever,
marked prostration and an early death. In more favorable cases
its adhesion to the bowel or to the abdominal wall opens the way
for rupture into the gut or externally and there may be a slow
healing of the cavity by granulation. It may be a month or two
before such an abscess opens and for a length of time thereafter
the health is poor, and the animal lacking in condition and endurance.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the abscess is formed in the <i>liver</i> there is high fever with
shivering fits, irregularity of the bowels (bound up or loose),
dusky or yellowish hue of the visible mucosæ, anorexia, followed
by peritoneal infection or pyæmia (secondary abscesses).</p>

<p class='c008'>Abscess of the <i>pancreas</i> or <i>spleen</i> is even less definite in symptoms.
These may terminate in rupture and peritonitis, or the
splenic abscess may become chronic and indolent and in a measure
harmless.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Perirenal Abscess</i> is betrayed by specially sensitive loins, stiffness
and groaning in rising or in turning sharply on himself,
drooping of the back under a load, and by albuminous urine. In
a small animal the part may be reached and the tenderness ellicited
by handling.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cutaneous Symptoms in Strangles.</i> Though by no means a
common form, strangles sometimes attacks the skin, more particularly
that of the face, head and neck, appearing in the form of
pustules or small abscesses, or it may be of a rounded nodular
elevation, which may disappear without forming either vesicle or
pustule. The points of election are around the lips, nose and
eyes, upon the mucosa inside the lips, along the line of the facial
lymphatics running toward the submaxillary gland, and at points
where there is special friction, as under the halter, collar, saddle,
crupper, in the hollow of the heel, under the tail, on the perineum,
in the groin and axilla. They may extend more or less up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>limbs, or around the point of primary attack attended by more or
less engorgement. When this engorgement has reached extensive
dimensions and is mixed with sanguineous extravasation it is
considered as having merged into petechial fever.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of Coital Infection.</i> From four to seven days after
copulation there appear fever, dullness, stiffness, anorexia, swelling
and heat of the lips of the vulva, a yellowish opaque discharge
from its lower commissure, a deep dark red blush of the
mucosa, with points of distinct infiltration and thickening, developing
into vesicles and pustules. The perineum, the groin
and mammæ often show an extension of the congestion and
eruption. In exceptional cases deep abscesses form and Letard
records a fatal case with extensive suppuration among the muscles
of the hind limbs and the haunch, inside the pelvis and along the
line of the aorta.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of Nervous Lesions.</i> The lesions of the brain and
spinal cord are usually secondary and often appear when the less
dangerous superficial manifestations, are tardy and indolent,
when the exudates are indurated and indisposed to soften. There
may be violent delirium, pushing of the head against the wall,
movements of the limbs as if walking or trotting, roaring, plunging,
striking with fore or hind feet, trismus or other muscular
spasms. More frequently there is great dulness, prostration, debility,
vertigo, drowsiness, amaurosis, paraplegia, general paralysis,
coma. If the lesion is in the spinal cord the spastic or paralytic
symptoms are likely to be confined to the hind parts.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fulminant or Septicæmic Form.</i> Bigoteau describes a rapidly
fatal, septicæmic form, with sudden onset, anorexia, extreme
prostration, uncertain stumbling gait, a deep blue color and
ecchymosis of the visible mucosæ, violent heart action, pulse
weak and small, hurried breathing (45 per minute) temperature
102° to 106° F., often inability to rise and death from asphyxia
in from two to five days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> In mild and regular cases this is easy. The attack
in rapid succession of all the young, and still susceptible horses
in a stable or locality, and the uniform coincidence of a profuse
nasal catarrh, and the formation between the branches of the
lower jaw, of a diffuse, hot, painful swelling rapidly advancing
to suppuration and discharge are virtually conclusive. Simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>catarrhs even if infective and attacking all young horses do not
cause phlegmon of the submaxillary lymph glands as occurs in
the great majority of cases of strangles. Glanders which is attended
by both nasal discharge and submaxillary swelling, is
slower in its onset, usually with little or no fever, has usually a
more adhesive discharge, ragged, unhealthy ulcers on the nasal
mucosa with a disposition to extend, often it shows cord-like
thickening of the lymphatics on the side of the face, and the submaxillary
swelling is smaller, made up of a number of small,
hard, insensible rounded nodules which show virtually no
tendency to suppurate. (See diagnosis of glanders). In cases
of doubt it may be advisable to inoculate a Guinea-pig and a
white mouse. The Guinea-pig resists a small dose, while the
mouse forms abscess in the seat of inoculation in the dependent
lymph glands. The Guinea-pig is very susceptible to glanders,
and the white mouse immune. Or mallein may be used.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis.</i> The mild type of strangles almost invariably terminates
favorably. In the irregular types with internal abscess the
prospect is grave in ratio with the size and multiplicity of the foci
and the vital importance of the organ invaded. In 15,421 cases
collected by Friedberger and Fröhner, and representing the total
in a series of outbreaks, but 3 per cent proved fatal. Much, however,
depends on the special potency of the germ. Horses contracting
this in a particular year or from a given stable in the
same year convey the disease to others in a malignant form, while
others that contracted it in another year or a different stable
infect with the mild form only.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> In the older countries horsemen too often accept
strangles as inevitable. They expect that all horses will have it
sooner or later, and it is not worth while to guard against it.
The too absolute doctrine of the identity of the germ with the
microbe of erysipelas, puerperal fever, contagious pneumonia,
influenza, of the suppurations of the limbs and feet in sheep and
cattle, and other streptococcic infections seems to corroborate this
view. But on the other hand the absence of strangles from given
countries like Iceland where erysipelas and its coadjutors are
common, its absence from secluded breeding farms and districts
in America, though prevailing all around them, the rapidity of its
spread when introduced in a sick colt, and the entire failure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>extend in the same way from an erysipelatous man to susceptible
young horses with which he comes in contact show that preventive
measures may be successfully applied for its restriction and
extinction. The conceded family resemblance of the microbes
and the experimental production, by their inoculation, of lesions
showing many points of similitude leave them still sufficiently
distinct in their pathogenesis to warrant measures for the suppression
of the variety which produces strangles.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Precautions for the private owner.</i> During the existence of
strangles in the district, <i>exclude strange horses, asses or mules</i> from
the farm or stable. Keep young susceptible horses from <i>public
stables or yards</i> (livery, feeding, training, fair, market, and above
all, dealers’ and sale stables) and even from <i>public drinking troughs</i>
and <i>buckets</i> used in common. Provide against their contact with
<i>manure</i> from strange or infected stables, or with <i>pastures</i>, <i>fields</i>
and <i>wagons</i> on which this has been put, also against the use
around the stable or on fodder of <i>forks</i> or <i>other implements</i> that
have been used for such manure. Avoid <i>hay</i> or other <i>fodder</i> or
<i>litter</i> from a strange barn or one that is open to any suspicion of
infection. Avoid <i>running water</i> that has drained land, stables,
or yards where strange horses have been, or those open to suspicion.
In shipping by car or other <i>public conveyance</i> disinfect
the latter before the animal is loaded. If a <i>second hand wagon,
shafts, pole, harness, blanket</i> or other object is brought on the
place or used, disinfect the same before using.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Measures for Sanitary Police.</i> Make it <i>compulsory to report</i>,
under penalty for failure, all cases of strangles, or of horses with
nasal discharge, or submaxillary swelling. Forbid removal from
the stable, or secluded enclosure, of all horses, etc., suffering in this
way or which have been pronounced by the official veterinarian to
have strangles. Provide for <i>exclusion of all other solipeds</i> from such
<i>stables</i>, or from <i>contact</i> or <i>dangerous proximity</i> to animals held in
them, also from <i>infected yards, parks, cars, boats, etc. Close public
drinking troughs</i> during an epizoötic; let each owner use his
own bucket. Circumstances may demand closure of public feeding
stables as well. <i>Forbid</i>, under penalty, <i>sale</i>, <i>exposure</i> or <i>movement</i>
on any <i>public highway</i> or <i>unfenced place</i> of any infected
(diseased or exposed) soliped. Enjoin <i>certificate of sanitary conditions
of stable and stud</i> with each animal sold. <i>Close dealers’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>stables</i>, or forbid any sale from them until all infection has ceased
and the buildings have been thoroughly disinfected. Compel
thorough <i>disinfection of stables, yards, cars, boats and other public
conveyances</i> that may be open to reasonable suspicion of infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization.</i> An attack renders the subject immune, but
this may be early overcome by marked change of location, and
exposure to a virus of greater intensity or modified quality.
Besides the crude and reckless Russian method already referred to,
direct inoculation of the virulent products has been often resorted
to from the time of Gohier onward, in the different countries
of Europe. By selecting the matter from the abscesses or nasal
discharge of a mild epizoötic, and preserving the inoculated
subjects in clean, dry, pure aired stables, on nourishing diet, and
under the best conditions of hygiene, a fair measure of immunity
was conferred with absolutely no loss. The same as after casual
cases, second attacks will sometimes be shown, but even in severe
outbreaks, of a less violent type. The pus from the abscess, or
the preceding exudate in the swelling may be simply rubbed on
the nasal mucosa, or injected subcutem in another part of the
body. In many cases there follows merely a local cellulitis, while
in others the general infection leads to the nasal discharge, with
or without the submaxillary abscess.</p>

<p class='c008'>This method is open to the individual owner where no concerted
effort is made to <i>stamp out</i> the infection. When, however,
police measures for suppression are in force, it must be strictly
prohibited, or adopted only under official control, and with
absolute seclusion and thorough disinfection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> In mild regular cases hygienic measures only are
demanded. Cleanliness, dry stalls, pure air, warmth (a sunny
exposure if available), nourishing, easily digested food, (grass,
green corn stalks, bran mashes, roots, carrots, turnips, apples,
potatoes, ensilage, scalded oats or hay) and pure water, or linseed
tea, grooming and, in cold weather, blanketing may suffice.
Rest is indispensable, though exercise may be allowed in a
sheltered or sunny field or yard in fine weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>Castrations and all other surgical operations are forbidden.</p>

<p class='c008'>For costiveness or tardy action of the bowels 1, 2 or 3 ozs. of
sulphate of soda may be allowed daily in the drinking water.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>To soothe the inflamed air-passages it is well to steam them
with the vapor of hot water to which has been added an antiseptic
such as oil of tar, tar, phenic acid, or creolin. This may be
placed in a bucket, and a bag with its bottom cut so as to form a
tube drawn over the bucket and nose of the horse. It may be
continued an hour or more at a time, or a nasal douche of creolin
(1:100) may be employed. In case of tardy softening of the
submaxillary swelling it may be assiduously fomented, or covered
with a linseed meal or other poultice to which a little
antiseptic (carbolic acid, creolin) has been added. It may be
applied on a cotton hood having holes for eyes and ears and
furnished with ends to tie back of the ears and down the middle
of the face. If still indolent the swelling may be rubbed with
soap liniment or smeared with soft soap, or finally a cantharides
blister may be applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as any indication of softening or fluctuation is detected
a free incision should be made to allow the exit of the pus. This
further tends to hasten the liquefaction and removal of the adjacent
exudate. If the pus lies near to the surface, with little more
than skin to penetrate, it may be freely incised with one thrust of
the knife, but if there is intervening glandular or other tissue,
the skin only should be first incised, and the connective tissue
bored through with the finger nail, or the point of a sterilized
director, or of closed scissors. In this way the important vessels,
nerves and salivary ducts are pushed aside and troublesome bleeding
and saliva fistula alike avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fever usually subsides on the opening of the abscess, but if it
fails to do so, or if it reappears from slight absorption of septic
matters it may be desirable to favor elimination by small doses of
sodium bicarbonate, ammonium chloride, or potassium nitrate.
In extreme cases a few doses of acetanilid may be given, or full
doses of quinia.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the discharge from nose or abscess threatens to persist,
such agents as sulphur, yellow or black sulphide of antimony,
are given with bitters, but a more prompt effect can usually be
had from injections of weak solutions of creolin, cresyl, lysol,
etc. When the cough is troublesome it may be quieted by belladonna,
or, in case of weakness of the heart, by digitalis.</p>

<p class='c008'>The various complications require treatment appropriate to
their nature. Collections of pus in the nasal sinuses may demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>trephining and antiseptic injections. Swellings about the
throat threatening asphyxia and which cannot be relieved by
evacuation of pus may necessitate tracheotomy until suppuration
occurs. The cutaneous pustules and abscesses are dealt with by
pricking the collections and washing daily or oftener with astringent
antiseptics (phenic acid and alum). Bronchitis and broncho-pneumonia
may be benefited by sinapisms applied to the sides of
the chest, the internal administration of potassium iodide, ammonium
chloride, sodium hyposulphite, terpene or terpinol; or by
inhalation of weak sulphur fumes, or tar vapor.</p>

<p class='c008'>For abscesses in the bronchial or mesenteric glands, the brain,
spinal cord, or other internal organ, little can usually be done
but to sustain the patient and await the course of events. If the
abscess can be accurately located it may be aspirated and then injected
with an antiseptic; if in the encephalon, trephining may
be resorted to; death is certain in such a case in the absence of
treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>During convalescence it is very important to avoid overexertion
and chill, which are very liable to bring on petechial fever. Also,
to feed nourishing food, give pure air and water, and to see that
no suspension of action of bowels, or kidneys threatens to shut
up toxins and waste products in the system. <i>Apropos</i> of impure
water Williams quotes the case of a foul stream near Bradford,
England, on the banks of which every case of strangles did badly.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Ataxic or Adynamic Pneumonia; Stable or Hospital
Pneumonia; Pleuro-Pneumonia Contagiosa Equorum; Contagious
Pleuro-Pneumonia; Bilious Pneumonia; Edematous
Pneumonia; Brustseuche.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An infectious adynamic type of pneumonia occurring
in horses, asses and mules, characterized by marked hyperthermia;
by infiltration of lung tissue, often bloody, infarcted
or caseated and usually circumscribed; by a deep yellow discoloration
of the visible mucosa and other white tissues; and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>complicating lesions of the pleura, heart, pericardium, liver, bowels,
or kidneys.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Historic Notes.</i> This affection was formerly confounded with
equine influenza, and it was only in the second third of the nineteenth
century that the differentiation was attempted. S. Prangé
describes this as a special epizoötic disease in the French hussars
in 1841, Leconturier in Belgium in 1845, Seidamgrotzky in Germany
in 1882 (strongly emphasizing the contagion), and Dieckerhoff
in Berlin in 1883. The latter showed that horses, recovered
and immune from influenza, still contracted brustseuche and perished.
This distinction was fully corroborated by Lustig, Cagnat
(1884), Brun, Delamotte (1886), Jolly, Benjamin, Leclainche,
Trasbot, and others. The presence of a particulate, living, self-multiplying
cause (microbe) was recognized as the essential condition
of the disease (as we still recognize the necessity for such
an organism to explain rabies) though the micro-organism itself
was as yet undiscovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same time many concurrent factors had to be considered
as accessory in different cases.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> <i>Young horses</i> often show a greater susceptibility
than older animals, mainly because they retain all the unimpaired
susceptibility of the colt, while old horses have already
passed through the disease and become immune. On the other
hand, in the absence of acquired immunity, the older, <i>worn out
and debilitated animals</i> are the most susceptible and tend to have
the disease in its worst form. <i>Susceptibility</i> and <i>immunity</i> are
therefore more important factors than mere age. Immunity usually
lasts for several years, or throughout life, yet in some animals,
or under given conditions, it is overcome much earlier. <i>Inclemency
of the weather</i>, or special exposure of any kind, as in severe
rainstorms, or working with the feet and legs in water, may become
the occasion of an attack. Exposure to cold <i>northwest
storms</i> (America, Atlantic Slope), or northeast (Europe), <i>standing
without blanket</i> in a temperature at zero, confinement in
<i>draughts of cold air</i> between doors or windows, without clothing
and after severe exercise, weaken the whole system and increase
susceptibility. The presence of a <i>nasal or bronchial catarrh</i>, or of
another debilitating disease may act in the same way. The weakened
tissues seem to invite the entrance of the germ. Palat, Boiteux
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and Trasbot found that horses with <i>local sores</i> or <i>suppurations</i>
fell readier victims than others;—perhaps the germs entered
by the traumas; perhaps the tone of the whole system was lowered,
so that the resistance was lessened.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Close</i>, <i>foul air</i>, <i>bad ventilation</i>, <i>imperfect sewerage</i>, and <i>overcrowded
stables</i> not only contribute strongly to infection but tend
to aggravate the cases. <i>Underfeeding</i> and <i>overwork</i> act in the
same way and in this connection may be named the <i>excitement</i>
and <i>exhaustion</i> attendant on a <i>long journey by rail</i>. This, like
the foul, crowded stable, furnishes many more opportunities for
infection and reinfection, so that the invasion of the exposed
animal system is all but certain. Infection clings to the <i>loading banks</i>,
<i>yards</i>, <i>feeding stables</i>, <i>mangers</i>, <i>troughs</i>, <i>buckets</i>, <i>cars</i>, <i>litter</i>,
and <i>manure</i>, so that young horses shipped from the west to the
Atlantic Coast States, very frequently come down with contagious
pneumonia, and contaminate the stables in which they are placed.
Peters suggests that the germ is preserved in the <i>soil water</i>, so
that after apparent subsidence it may be again brought to the
surface in time of rains or freshets, to start a new epizoötic.
<i>Convalescent horses</i> may carry the germ for weeks, on the mucosa
or in sequestra in the lungs, and contaminate horses with which
they come in contact.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is remarkable that the contagious pneumonia is far less diffusible
on the air than influenza, so that it is much more constantly
the result of direct contact of a sound, with an infected
animal, or with a place or thing that the sick animal has contaminated.
It therefore spreads much less rapidly, remains confined
to individual stables for a length of time, and in the absence
of active interchange of horses tends to die out of its own
accord. As the infection is not generally and speedily acquired,
so immunity fails to become general, and the infection tends to
fix itself permanently in places where many strange horses congregate,
(market stables, sale stables, livery stables, etc.), and
the constant influx of fresh animals keeps the flame burning by
accessions of fresh fuel. In such cases it is manifest that the
germ outside the animal body either rests in a dry condition, or
lives as a saprophyte in earth or organic matter, and often loses
much of its virulence. Under such circumstances animals that
would prove readily susceptible to a virulent germ, prove nonreceptive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to this resting germ, until under some special devitalizing
influence, like exposure, exhaustion or local disease, it
finds its opportunity and the weakened system succumbs. Then,
acquiring new force through its life in the debilitated system, it
starts on a recrudescence, and an epizoötic is mistakenly supposed
to have started without a preëxisting microbian cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cadeac even advocates the theory that the same germ possessed
of greater or lesser virulence, is always present in ordinary
stables and horses, and habitually causes in exposed or debilitated
animals an ordinary fibrinous pneumonia with no perceptible
tendency to transmission by contagion; that, in other cases
when a considerable number of horses have their defensive
powers impaired, it gains a wide extension; and, that in some
such cases, the germ that has been living as a comparatively
harmless saprophyte, suddenly acquires an unwonted potency,
and breaking down the barrier of partial immunity, attacks exposed
animals on a large scale and irrespective of weather perturbations,
or debilitated conditions. He quotes from Trasbot instances that
seem to support this hypothesis, which is not at all in disaccord
with the habits of bacterial life, yet we require a solid basis in
bacteriological experiment to make it unassailable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> Siedamgrotzky (1882) found in the hæmorrhagic
centres in the affected lung and in the pleural exudate <i>micrococci</i>.
Dieckerhoff (1882) and Mendelsohn (1883) found in the pleural
exudate streptococci. Chain cocci were also found by Peterlein
(1884), Perroncito (1885), Delamotte and Chantemesse (1888),
and Mosselman and Lienaux (1893).</p>

<p class='c008'>Schütz (1887) found a diplococcus which he studied very fully
and this is corroborated by Lustig’s ovoid bacterium, by Cadeac’s
micrococcus and diplococcus. In Dr. V. A. Moore’s cultures at
the N. Y. S. Veterinary College cocci were found constantly in
pure culture, sometimes as a diplococcus, but under slightly altered
conditions the streptococcus form predominated. As the
difference between two, and three or more cocci in chain form is
merely a question of early or late separation of cocci which multiply
in line, the apparent discrepancies in the above observations
do not imply any real difference in the microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inoculated in pure cultures the Schütz diplococcus killed mice
in 24 to 48 hours with enhanced virulence of the germ. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span><i>rabbit</i>, <i>subcutem</i>, it usually killed in 24 to 48 hours, but some
survived; <i>intravenously</i> or <i>intratrachealy</i> it killed more certainly
and speedily and in either case with pleural, pericardial and even
peritoneal lesions. In the <i>Guinea-pig</i>, <i>subcutem</i>, it caused extensive
effusion, and death in two to six days with chest lesions.
In the <i>dog</i> it caused hyperthermia, but no marked lesion and no
mortality. In the <i>horse</i> there were no infectious resultant
lesions. A pure culture thrown into the lung tissue of an old
horse at the N. Y. S. V. College, determined an extended pleuritic
adhesion and lung hepatization. The age of this subject was opposed
to any marked susceptibility. The apparent immunity of
the horse in Schutze’s cases might depend on the insusceptibility
of the animals selected during or after an epizoötic, or on the
absence of the predisposing causes so strongly insisted on by
Cadeac.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rats, chickens and pigs proved immune.</p>

<p class='c008'>On peptonized gelatin at 98° F., and less rapidly at ordinary
temperature, it grew as white, opaque, colonies which gradually
extended and united in many cases. The gelatin was not liquefied.
In peptonized bouillon it produces turbidity for one or two
days, after which the microbe precipitates leaving the liquid clear.
The reaction is unchanged.</p>

<p class='c008'>It lost virulence rapidly when kept in artificial culture or at a
temperature of 122° F., and was killed by a temperature of
150° F. Yet it survived drying at moderate temperatures.
Cadeac found that the dried expectoration or blood, diffused in
the inspired air produced pneumonia with certainty in solipeds.
Schütz and Fiedaler injected pure cultures into the lung, and in
other cases into the trachea, thereby inducing pneumonia.
Twenty grammes of the culture injected into the trachea raised
the temperature 2° or 3°, but this lessened on repetition and
after four or five treatments the subject proved immune.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres (1897) discovered his <i>cocco-bacillus</i> in the exudation
in the tissues in the early stages of contagious pneumonia, from
which it disappears, giving place to other bacteria, and usually
streptococcus, as the disease reaches its maximum. (See Equine
Influenza for description). His theory is that the cocco-bacillus,
which is slightly smaller than the bacillus of chicken cholera,
and appears like a diplococcus when stained, and which may not
be found after the first eight days of infectious pneumonia, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>starting point of disease, in this and influenza, making the system
very receptive of the streptococcus of strangles and of other
bacteria, the identity of which determines the nature of the
malady. The diplococcus or streptococcus of Schütz in his
opinion is none other than the strangles streptococcus which finding
a congenial home in the animal invaded by his cocco-bacillus,
pervades the system and determines the pathological phenomena
of contagious pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are certain obstacles to the unreserved acceptance of
Lignieres’ conclusions, among the chief of which is the absence
of evidence that horses, successfully inoculated with his cocco-bacillus
in pure cultures, can infect others standing near them
with the same rapidity and certainty, as does the casual case of
influenza, or even of contagious pneumonia. The same holds true
of the supposed identity of the streptococcus and that of strangles.
Abscesses containing streptococci, were formed in the seats of
inoculation with Schütz’s organism, but there is no evidence that
the horses suffering from such abscess affected susceptible horses
standing beside them, as do ordinary cases of strangles. The
cocco-bacillus may be a concurrent cause of contagious pneumonia,
but we need more proof to show that it is the essential
cause, even as we need proof of the absolute identity of the
streptococcus of strangles and brustseuche.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The pneumonia is far more likely to be double than
in the fibrinous form, and the area invaded, in its ratio with the
high intensity of the fever, is usually less. The consolidations
are especially common near the lower borders of the anterior parts
of the lungs. There may, however, be a number of centres in
each lung, to be accounted for by the inhalation of the germ and
the starting of the morbid process at the various points on which
it falls. This, like the double character of pneumonia is therefor
in keeping with the contagious origin. Each centre of condensation
shows a small area, hepatized, purulent or necrotic, with a
surrounding zone of dark bluish red congestion. The consolidated
areas are less dry and granular than in fibrinous pneumonia,
seeming to be largely infiltrated with a still liquid exudate
and dark blood, and thus tend to a greater tenacity, and less
friability. Black areas of infarction form in the lung, the thrombosis
of the arteries, cutting off the free normal circulation and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the isolated portion fills up with dark blood globules and forms a
sequestrum. In the inflammatory and still living parts the color
is lighter with, it may be, some straw colored exudate, and
always an active leucocytosis, as in other inflamed parts. When
infiltration is located near the root of the lung, it is usually attached
to the primary bronchi, or larger bronchia and may extend
into the upper portion or almost the entire substance of the lung.</p>

<p class='c008'>Simple abscess is rare, yet purulent sacs containing the gangrenous
masses or sequestra are common.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pleuritic areas are common over the congested and hepatized
foci, yet as these are usually circumscribed in extent, an excessive
hydrothorax is exceptional. Yet the pleuritic effusion may
at times become abundant. Friedberger and Fröhner say seven
gallons or more. It may become purulent or even septic, exhaling
an offensive odor. Adhesions and fringes on the pleura are
frequent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>heart and pericardium</i> may be affected, the first showing
the pallid, soft, or parboiled appearance of high fever, with at
times fatty degeneration or petechiæ, and the latter congestion,
exudation, thickening, false membranes and liquid effusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The enlargement of the <i>congested liver</i> is a marked feature. It
frequently attains the weight of 30 pounds. It may ooze dark
blood freely from the cut surface, has usually a yellowish tinge,
and shows points of fatty degeneration or even of commencing
necrosis. The spleen is like the liver, charged with blood, and
shows an increase of pulp and even petechiæ or circumscribed
hæmorrhages.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>kidneys</i> are congested, friable and petechiated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>bronchial lymph glands</i> and less constantly the mediastinal
and abdominal ones, are congested, pink to dark red and somewhat
enlarged.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gastric and intestinal mucosa may be congested, thickened,
hæmorrhagic or ulcerated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The white tissues generally tend to an icteric hue, and the
muscles assume a mahogany aspect.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation</i> appears to be longer than in equine influenza, varying
in different cases from 3 to 10 days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> These vary greatly in different cases, <i>mild</i> and
<i>severe</i>. Some, in the same stable with the severe cases, simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>refuse food, are a little sluggish in work, cough, have hyperthermia
(104° to 106° F.), respirations 20–25, pulse 60, with
conjunctiva only moderately yellow, a slightly yellowish discharge
from the nose, and no observable lung consolidation. The
temperature descends to normal in three to five days, the symptoms
generally abate, and the animal may be convalescent in eight
or ten days.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the more <i>severe cases</i> there may be seen a shivering fit, or it
may pass unobserved. Then the first morbid phenomenon is usually
a rapid and extreme elevation of temperature which may
reach 104° or 106° F. in a few hours. With this there is great
impairment or complete loss of appetite, and a loss of life and
energy. In some cases the depression, stupor and muscular
weakness suggest influenza but this is not the rule. Still more
rare is infiltration of the eyelids and free watering of the eyes, yet
in the absence of this, drooping of the upper eyelids is not uncommon.
The respiration may be accelerated and short, from 20
to 30 per minute, and the pulse, which is usually small and weak
in spite of the fever, may rise to 50 or 70 per minute. The
breathing may be trembling or distinctly interrupted in the course
of inhalation or exhalation, short and with no interval between
inspiration and expiration. Cough may or may not be a marked
feature, heard at long intervals only in some cases and frequent
and painful in others. It is liable to be dry and husky rather
than hard, loose or gurgling. The eye and to a less extent the
nasal and buccal mucosa tend to show a yellowish shade, and
this may even at an early stage show a distinct brownish
orange, or even a dark mahogany hue. Yet dropsy of the lids
or even epiphora are uncommon. A yellowish discharge from
the nose is an almost constant feature and this may dry up into a
yellow crust on the floor of the anterior nares and adjacent skin.
The percussion and auscultatory indications of lung consolidation
are rarely obtainable before the end of the second or third day
and when at all extensive can usually be detected on both sides.
Trasbot considers the double pneumonia as almost pathognomonic
of contagious pneumonia. When confined mainly to the lower
parts of the lungs and occurring in isolated areas, with lung tissue
still pervious to air in the intervals, it comes more nearly to being
so. Crepitation round the border of consolidated areas, is a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>marked feature than in equal consolidations in influenza. It
often becomes inaudible again as the disease advances. Blowing
murmurs, coarse mucous râles, heart and intestinal sounds can
often be heard with unusual clearness, in unusual situations,
when an area of consolidated lung is immediately beneath. A
transient dry friction sound of commencing pleurisy is sometimes
detected over a tender intercostal area, but soon giving place to
the uniform quiet of effusion rising to a given horizontal level.
Later still there may be the creaking sound of organizing false
membranes in process of being stretched, and which is so often
confounded with crepitation. The indications of pneumothorax
(tympanitic resonance, and metallic tinkling), are rare. In advanced
stages there may be tympanitic sound from the cavities of
abscesses or the sacs containing sequestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>The urine is always scanty and high colored and may at times
prove red and hæmorrhagic. Albuminuria is usually present
when the disease is at its height. The same is true of uric acid,
which replaces the hippuric acid, in cases of high fever and complete
abstinence so that the products are drawn from the disintegrating
tissues alone. The returning appetite, and the
restoration of a neutral or alkaline condition of the urine, therefore
tend to occur simultaneously, and to mark improvement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Great tenderness of the throat, protrusion of the nose, and
difficulty of swallowing mark the localization of the lesions on
the pharynx and larynx. It is liable to be accompanied by the
introduction of exudation and food materials into the larynx and
trachea with the occurrence of inhalation bronchitis and pulmonary
gangrene.</p>

<p class='c008'>Symptoms of pericarditis, endocarditis and myocarditis, are
especially common in the more severe types of the disease. With
soft, weak or imperceptible pulse and tumultuous heart beats they
may be suspected, and further indications are a transient friction
sound, synchronous with the beat of the heart, intermissions,
murmurs with first or second heart sound, and an increasingly
low, distant, or muffled heart beat, as pericardial fluid accumulates.
As in the case of troubles with the kidneys or liver, stocking
of the legs, or dropsical swellings elsewhere may appear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exceptionally, acute nervous symptoms may appear, due to
functional derangements caused by circulation of the toxins and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>metabolic products, or even to congestion or inflammation of the
brain or its membranes. This may occur at the outset of the
disease indicating the election of the nerve centres for the colonization
of the microbe, and advancing to a rapidly fatal issue
(Friedberger and Fröhner). It may set in with hepatization
(Rey), or it may coincide with pulmonary gangrene (Cadeac).
There may be merely dulness, prostration, or stupor; or trembling,
unsteady gait, or falling; there may be rolling of the eyes,
or amaurosis, or vertigo occurring intermittently; or there may
be epileptic attacks or paraplegia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Course.</i> In moderate cases the disease may last from two to
three weeks, and in well conditioned horses, with strong constitutions,
tends to recovery. On the third to the eighth day all the
symptoms appear better, appetite, expression, alertness, breathing,
pulsation and temperature. The temperature which has been a
degree, or more, higher in the afternoon than in the morning,
remains about the same from morning to night, or is even slightly
lowered; it is lower still next morning and in two or three days
may have reached 101°, still rising a little in the afternoon. The
pulmonary exudate is usually quickly absorbed though less so
than in favorable cases of influenza. Convalescence may be
completed by the end of the third or fourth week.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>violent</i> and <i>fatal cases</i> the general symptoms tend to encrease
in violence, though the temperature may descend to 103°, and in
the final collapse to 100° or lower. In a mare presented at the
college clinic after three weeks illness and treatment elsewhere,
prostration was extreme, the head rested in the manger, the nose
discharged a fetid, glairy, frothy liquid, with grumous, bloody
debris; breath offensive; pulse 92, almost imperceptible; respirations
30, very labored; nostrils widely dilated, flapping;
temperature in vagina 103.6°, anus was open with constant ingress
and egress of air, and a watery glairy, frothy discharge;
extensive dropsy under the sternum; percussion and auscultation
indicated consolidation of lungs from the lower border up, crepitation,
creaking, and loud clucking bronchial sound. The mare
survived for forty-eight hours, the temperature descending to
100.5° in the morning and rising to 102° and upward in the afternoon.
At the necropsy the right lung was consolidated throughout,
the left had pervious areas anteriorly and posteriorly; there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>were large areas of infarction, necrosis, with encystment, caseation,
and lobular and perilobular exudation and hepatization.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liver, enlarged, tense in its capsule, but soft and friable on its
cut surface, with areas of softening and necrosis. Both kidneys
congested, with pale zones of necrosis; right enlarged. Beside
the substernal exudate, there was extensive hæmorrhagic exudate
between the serratus magnus and ribs. The blood, very dark,
brightened on exposure to air.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis</i>: This may be based mainly on the prevalence of
the disease in the district, or the fact that the victim has come
from a long railway journey with risks of exposure, or has stood
by a horse just arrived; on the prompt loss of appetite and sudden
and extreme rise of temperature, without notable lung
lesions; on the deep brownish yellow discoloration of the visible
mucosæ, especially that of the eye, and on the yellow discharge
from the nose, the tardiness with which successive cases follow
each other comparatively to influenza, and the absence in large
measure of the early extreme prostration of that affection. (See
table under <i>influenza</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis</i> varies with the progress of an epizoötic, and the
youth and susceptibility of the animal together with the favorable
or unfavorable conditions of life. The death rate is usually high
at the outset when the more susceptible animals are attacked, and
for the same reason, in the young that have not been previously
exposed. Old and debilitated animals with broken down constitutions
suffer severely, and bad hygiene contributes much to
the mortality. The deaths vary from one to twenty per cent.
But short of death, permanent injury follows in a number of
cases. Encysted sequestra remain in the lungs for months and
when liquefied and absorbed, leave fibroid masses in place of
healthy lung tissue. The fibrous organization of peribronchial
exudates, impairs respiration, and the same is true of the fibrous
development of false membrane. Thus the horse is left permanently
<i>broken-winded</i> or <i>short-winded</i>, or from interference with
the recurrent laryngeal nerve, laryngeal hemiplegia (roaring)
ensues. In still other cases permanent adhesions of the pericardium,
or insufficiency of the cardiac valves, or disease and
distortion of joints or tendons, or nervous, hepatic or renal degenerations
destroy or seriously impair the value.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span><i>Treatment.</i> Hygienic measures are of prime importance in
treatment. A dry, clean box stall with pure air, and genial
warmth (60°–70° F.)—in warm summer weather outdoor air—must
be secured. In cold weather a sunny outlook, and clothing—blanket,
bandages, and it may be a hood—to counteract any
sensation of chill. Tepid drinks, pure water changed often, linseed
tea, barley water, are of importance in allaying thirst,
lowering temperature and favoring elimination. Absolute rest is
all essential. Keeping at work after the onset of the disease is
nearly equivalent to signing the patient’s death warrant.</p>

<p class='c008'>The high temperature at the outset of the disease seems to demand
antipyretics, and in times past, in Southern Europe especially,
bleeding was a constant resort. But even under favorable conditions
this does not lower the temperature more than 1.5° F.,
and the resulting debility is such that it has been long discarded
in Germany, England and America. In cases of acute extensive
pulmonary congestion it is helpful in relieving the vascular
tension on the lungs and allowing the tissues to better reassert
their natural functions, in antagonism with invading microbes
and their poisons, but even this action is transient, and when it
saves life it is probably only by tiding over safely a very transient
and urgent danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same decline of temperature can usually be secured by
injections of cool water into the rectum, and with the added advantage
that this relaxes the bowels, and removes dried irritant
masses from the rectum and floating colon.</p>

<p class='c008'>As in other pneumonias the application of cold to the skin is
liable to bring on a chill unless the temperature is very high.
A safer and hardly less <a id='t106'></a>effective method is to apply around the
chest a thin blanket or sheet wrung out of tepid water and cover
it closely with dry blankets holding these close to the skin by
elastic circingles. No part of the damp compress must be allowed
to remain exposed to the air under pain of causing chill.
Damp cotton wool applied next the skin tends to maintain its
contact by its own elasticity, so that it requires less care in the
elastic dry covering. This moist warmth draws a free circulation
of blood to the skin, so that it is cooled and sent back internally
to cool the burning fever, without sensation of chill.
The abstraction of this large mass of blood to the skin, acts like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>bleeding in diminishing the blood tension in the chest and allowing
the resumption of the normal vaso-motor and nutritive functions
without the dangers of venesection. The soothing action on the
skin, soothes by sympathy the infected and inflamed tissues.</p>

<p class='c008'>A steam or hot air bath may serve a similar purpose. Conjoined
with an aloetic laxative and aconite, I have seen this
reduce the temperature from 104.5° F. to 102.7° F. at the next
taking 18 hours later. It only once again reached 103° F. in the
subsequent course of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>To secure diaphoresis, warm mashes or gruels may be freely
used. Alcoholic drinks have been freely used (the weaker wines
1 to 2 qts., sherry, brandy, whisky ½ to 1 pint), camphorated
spirit (2–3 drs.) subcutem, ipecacuan (1 oz.), tartar emetic (2
drs.), liquor of acetate of ammonia (4 ozs.), pilocarpin (2 grs.
subcutem). If the alcoholic liquors produce a free circulation
and glow in the skin, better still if diaphoresis, they are useful
antithermics, but, if they fail in this, they may do harm by
reducing the vital activities of the leucocytes, and their power
of resistance. Trasbot has had uniformly unfortunate results
with alcohol in large doses. The same objection attaches to
tartar emetic and other depressant diaphoretics, though valuable
if free diaphoresis is secured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Constipation may be met by cold water injections, calomel (½
to 1 dr.), pilocarpin (3 grs.), eserine (1½ gr.), sodium sulphate
or other agent graduated to requirement.</p>

<p class='c008'>An expectorant and alkaline diuretic action may be obtained
from potassium iodide (1–2 drs.), ammonium chloride (2 drs.),
or ammonium acetate. These not only liquefy the exudate, and
facilitate expectoration, but secure elimination of toxins, ptomaines
and waste products from the blood and system. The iodide is
besides somewhat antiseptic.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the early stages especially medicinal antithermic agents may
be called for: acetanilid (2–3 drs.), phenacetin (2–4 drs.), sulphate
of thallin (2–3 drs.), sodium salicylate (½ oz.) or in the
weaker cases, caffein—natrium salicylate (1 dr.) or quinine sulphate
(2–3 drs.) Acetanilid will sometimes relieve dullness, and
materially improve the general condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>In weak conditions of the heart we may resort to digitalis (10–15
grs.), strychnia sulphate (2 grs.), strophanthus tincture (3 to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>4 drs.), caffein, or alcohol. Care must be taken not to overstimulate
and exhaust a weak and intermittent heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Derivatives are often of material value from the first, in mild
cases or to succeed damp compresses in the more violent ones.
One of the best and most convenient is essential oil of mustard
and alcohol (1:12 or 20). This may be rubbed on the surface
and like mustard itself, covered with stout paper to prevent
evaporation. In the absence of this, soap liniment, or even tincture
of cantharides may be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use of antiseptics has been tried with variable results.
While it is impracticable to saturate the system, safely, with sufficient
antiseptic to destroy the microbes in the blood and tissues,
yet when the balance of force between the microbian attack
and systemic defence shows little variation either way a
slight increase on the side of the patient may serve to give it the
preponderance, and to restrict the increase of the microbes and
their products. Above all when the center of morbid activity is
largely on and near the bronchial mucosa, antiseptic inhalations
serve to hold them somewhat in check and to moderate the
amount of both microbes and toxins that enter the system at this
point. For this purpose camphor, oil of turpentine, or oil of tar
volatilized from hot water may be inhaled in a close room. Or
we may use carbolic acid, terpene, terpinol, creolin lysol, thymol,
eucalyptol, or oil of cinnamon. The fumes of burning sulphur
diffused in the air of the room and just short of that concentration
that will cause cough, suffering and headache, is an excellent
resort. The sulphites, bisulphites or hyposulphites may be
given by the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>When there are indications of encephalitis cold to the head
and the internal exhibition of bromides, iodides, and acetanilid
may be resorted to.</p>

<p class='c008'>During convalescence nourishing and easily digestible food may
be given, and iron, strychnia, quinia and common salt may be
employed. In protracted or chronic cases with fœtid breath and
indications of sequestra or opened vomica in the lungs these may
be continued along with one or more of the disinfectants referred
to above.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> This is much more promising than in equine influenza.
The extension of incubation to three days and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>indisposition of the infection to spread beyond the stable into
which it has been brought, or the near vicinity of the diseased
animal, gives us a great relative advantage. The early, extreme
rise of temperature of the infected horses gives the opportunity
of removing these horses to a special stable or shed, where they
can have special attendants, and the stable drainage and manure
can be kept apart, and disinfected, or spread and plowed under
by oxen. The infected stable should be emptied, the soiled hay,
litter and manure burned, and the walls, partitions, floors, ceilings,
and above all the mangers and racks must be thoroughly
disinfected. Lime wash with chloride of lime or mercuric
chloride will suffice. The gutters should be cleaned, washed and
drenched with mercuric chloride, followed by the whitewash.
If there is rotten wood work or filth-saturated soil these must be
effectually treated. In many stables it will be impossible to do
all this thoroughly, yet closing the empty building tightly, and
filling it with chlorine gas, or even sulphur fumes, concentrated
until they extinguish the burning sulphur, and keeping shut up
for twenty-four hours will usually suffice. Washing with a solution
of formalin (1:40 or 1 per cent of formaldehyde), or even
the evaporation of this agent by heat in the closed building is
very effective, with the serious drawback that it is very irritating
to the lungs. It can however be conveniently used for the
sterilization of harness, stable implements, halters, and all
movable objects in the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strange horses, such as new purchases, should be placed in
quarantine for one week in a separate stable, and not hitched up
with sound horses. If they show evidence of recent illness this
may be extended to six weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>For horses that have been shipped long distances, and stopped
for rest or feeding in public stables or yards, a similar quarantine
is essential. This might be obviated if a system of thorough disinfection
of such stables, yards and cars, could be enforced, between
any two successive lots of horses, and if the latter were
accompanied by certificates of the absence of contagious pneumonia
and all other infectious diseases from the localities from which
they were shipped and through which they had come. Such certificates
should be made by veterinary officials in the employ of
the government, which would thus become responsible for their
genuineness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>In view of the frequent persistence of this malady in a given
stable for a great length of time, successive animals being attacked
at long intervals, and where isolation was impracticable, Beckmann
rubbed the nasal discharges of the sick on the nasal mucosa
of the unaffected, producing the disease almost invariably in a
mild form. The infected animals were placed in the best hygienic
conditions, the duration of the infection was shortened,
and the horses being rendered immune, the stable was then disinfected
with a satisfactory result.</p>

<p class='c008'>Schütz, Hill, Pilz and a number of others have sought artificial
immunity, by the injection of blood serum from a horse that has
recently recovered from the malady. The results were very contradictory.
In some cases the disease came to a sudden end. In
other stables no new cases appeared either in those treated with
serum or in those left without treatment. In other experiments,
new cases occurred among those treated with the serum;—in
Weishaupt’s cases after a lapse of one or two months. This is
exactly what might be expected. If the horse supplying the
blood serum had really recovered, and if the microbes (streptococci)
had disappeared from the blood, the latter would of necessity
retain little of the toxins, but much more of the antitoxins,
the active production of which would be continued by the stimulated
leucocytes. These antitoxins would neutralize the toxins,
in case of invasion and prevent that from reaching the maximum
of intensity that it would otherwise have reached, but would be
powerless to stimulate the leucocytes of the inoculated animal into
the habit of themselves producing antitoxins. This would act
rather as a curative than a prophylactic agent, and its value would
be spent as soon as the injected antitoxins were eliminated from
the system.</p>

<p class='c008'>The true line of inquiry would have been, whether injection of
the toxins, which acting on the leucocytes would have stimulated
these to the habit of producing antitoxins in large amount, might
not be expected to give an immunity as lasting as that which
follows on a casual attack of the disease. Lignieres appears
to have approximated to this, in his experiments on mice
and rabbits. In horses suffering from contagious pneumonia it
lowered the temperature, but did not materially affect the result
of the attack. If we adhere to Lignieres’ own theory of causation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>by cocco-bacillus and later by streptococcus or some other complicating
infection, we can scarcely hope that the toxins of the
streptococcus or other complicating microbe will immunize against
the cocco-bacillus or mutually against each other. If complete
protection is aimed at, the toxins of his cocco-bacillus, and of
Schütz’s streptococcus, and of any other possible microbe which
may produce a secondary complication, ought to be employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the date of this writing no satisfactory sero-therapy for this
disease has been worked out and publicly demonstrated.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>INFECTIOUS STABLE BRONCHITIS. SCALMA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> An infectious inflammation, of the upper air passages
and bronchia, attended by high fever, special nervous
irritability and a protracted convalescence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dieckerhoff gave the name <i>scalma</i> (rogue) to outbreaks in
given stables of an infection, showing the high temperature of
brustseuche, (104° to 107° F.) a similar incubation (6 to 7 days),
a correspondingly tardy extension from animal to animal, and
duration of the disease. The apparent differences are in the
absence of the profound dulness, the yellowness of the mucosæ, and
the yellow or rusty nasal discharge, in the ready response to the
voice or touch, the disposition to bite or kick, the spasms of the
larynx and sudden dyspnœa, in certain cases, and the paroxysmal
cough in others. Apart from these transient respiratory
troubles the pulse and breathing are unaffected, relatively to the
elevation of temperature. Sometimes the jaws are kept in constant
motion, from nervousness or pharyngeal trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the absence of any conclusive bacteriological investigation,
it may be surmised that this is a form of brustseuche which has
not advanced to the same grade of destruction of red globules and
prostration of the nerve centres, the latter showing only an excited
and irritable condition.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> and <i>prevention</i> do not differ materially from what is
required in contagious pneumonia. The irritable cough may be
soothed by inhalations of warm water vapor, with alcohol, camphor,
eucalyptol, or opium, or electuaries of bromides, belladonna
or stramonium, and local derivatives to the throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most cases are mild and recover in a week, the cough lasting
for two weeks more.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>OTHER INFECTIOUS PNEUMONIAS OF THE HORSE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Claims have been made for infections by a variety of other
germs which it would be difficult or unreasonable to deny. In
given conditions of the horse’s lung it may succumb to the attacks
of pathogenic microörganisms which at other times or under
other conditions would be practically harmless. Thus the round ended
bacillus of Friedländer is claimed by Jacquot and others to
cause one form of pneumonia in the horse as it does in man (Vol.
1 p. 216). Again Galtier and Violet have claimed a form of
pneumonia transmitted through musty or spoilt fodders and
attacking the bowels as well as the lungs (pneumo-enteritis).
Two micro-organisms are accused, a diplococcus and streptococcus,
which is strongly suggestive of the now familiar germ of
brustseuche.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An infectious fever of solipeds, of a specially low or

or nervous system.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease was long confounded with the <i>influenza</i> of man
and while compelled for the identification of the affection, to
retain this name in combination with the qualification <i>equine</i>, yet
we would prefer to discard it entirely as conveying the idea that
the illness is caused by Pfeiffer’s bacillus, which it is not. The
term <i>typhoid fever</i> which is in common use in France, has been
selected to convey the impression of its two prominent features of
<i>hyperthermia</i> and <i>stupor</i>. But it is open to the same objection
for it has been long applied to a specific disease in man having
its own bacillus which is not present in the <i>equine influenza</i>.
<i>Septicæmia Hæmorrhagica</i> which has been adopted more lately,
however correct it may be as indicating the tendency of the local
lesions has a generic meaning rather than a specific one, and
requires much more qualification to correctly designate the disease.
The term <i>adynamic catarrhal fever of solipeds</i> has this
recommendation, that it expresses the prostration and debility
which is such a marked feature of the disease, its great tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>to become localized on mucous surfaces, and the genus of animals
that prove its victims. A better designation is still desirable and
may perhaps be reached, when the pathogenic microbe shall be
demonstrated beyond question.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Historic Notes.</i> Among catarrhal fevers and epizoötics of early
times it is impossible to distinguish this from widespread nasal
and bronchial catarrhs, and from contagious pneumonia (brustseuche),
yet when the epizoötic attained a sudden and wide
extension without any direct climatic cause, the presumption is in
favor of the disease now before us. Hints are obtained from Titus
Livius of a Sicilian equine epizoötic of this kind 412 B. C. This
is corroborated by an account by Hippocrates of a similar outbreak
in Greece. Later, Virgil (Georgics), Columella, Absyrtus
and Vegetius give similar hints. In 1299 in Seville horses suffered
with drooping head, watery eyes, beating flanks and anorexia
and 1000 died (Laurentius Rusius). The horses of the
French Army in Germany suffered severely in 1648 (Solleysel),
horses in England in 1688 (Short, Rutty), again in 1693 (Webster,
Short, Foster) and again in 1699 (Webster). In 1712
horses suffered extensively in Europe (Lancisi, Kanold) and in
1727–8 in England and Ireland (Rutty), in 1732–3 (Arbuthnot,
Gibson) and again in 1736–7 (Short). Other such equine epizoötics
are recorded for Europe in 1729 (Löw), for Ireland in
1746 and 1750–1 (Rutty, Osmer), for Europe and the British
Isles in 1760 (Bieset, Rutty, Webster), and again in 1762 (Rutty,
Webster) and 1767 (Forster), also in America (Webster), in
Europe in 1776 (Fothergill etc.), in Europe and Asia in 1780–2
(Gluge), in England in 1798 (Wilkinson, White), in Europe and
England in 1814–15 (Heusinger, Wilkinson, Youatt), in England
in 1819, 1823 (Field) and 1827 (Brown), in Europe in 1833
(Prinz, Wilkinson, Hayes, Spooner), 1834 (Hensinger), 1835–6
(Prinz, Friedberger), 1840, 1846, 1851, 1852, 1862, 1870, 1873,
1881, 1883, 1890, 1891, 1892 (Friedberger).</p>

<p class='c008'>In the United States as in Europe the affection has in the main
smoldered in the large cities in ordinary years, to break out without
obvious cause, in given years into an advancing epizoötic
which sweeps the whole continent. Such were the great outbreaks
in Europe in 1881 to 1883, and in America in 1872–3, and
1900 to 1901. The great recrudescence of the disease in North
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>America in 1872–3 was so remarkable in its progress and limitations
that it seems desirable to recal its more prominent historic
features. The unquestionable demonstration of the microbe of
the affection may make such a record superfluous, but until then,
and so long as books are published which attribute the disease to
the environment, or to the soil, it is not altogether unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the deductions from this record are:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The affection advanced gradually from Toronto over the
whole continent of North America, where horses are kept, taking
full ten months to accomplish this. Nothing checked its advance,
over lowland and highland, swamp and arid land, in summer as
in winter, with a temperature at 0° or at 100° F., in country
pasture or in city street or stable, idle or overworked, on all kinds
of soils and geological formations, under all successive conditions
of meteoric and terrestrial electricity, in all conditions of the
air—pure, impure, dense, light, moist and dry. No one condition
of the environment operating on the animal system, can
be conceived of that could advance as this disease did from place to
place in regular sequence for this length of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. The rapidity of its progress was manifestly subordinate to
the activity of the movement of the equine races from points already
infected. Its most rapid advance was along the lines of
railway while the back districts shut out from railway traffic were
much later in being invaded. The larger cities situated on the
through railroad routes suffered earlier than the smaller places on
the same lines. The outbreak was several days earlier in
Montreal than in the nearer and smaller cities of Kingston,
Ottawa, Belleville, Port Hope, Peterboro, Stratford, Brantford,
Guelph, London and Owen Sound. The important port of St.
John, N. B., suffered two weeks earlier than Quebec. Along the
N. Y. Central and Erie Railways etc., Boston and New York
suffered nearly a week earlier than Utica, Poughkeepsie, Binghampton,
Elmira, and Jamestown, while the smaller places like
Kingston, Nyack, Ithaca, etc., were later still. In Baltimore the
disease was seen a day earlier than in Philadelphia, and in these
cities and Washington over a fortnight before it was seen in
Scranton, Pa. So it was almost everywhere and in these large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>cities the outbreak could in nearly every case be traced to horses
just arrived from a pre-existing centre of infection. In Detroit,
Syracuse and Chicago it spread first in stables that had just received
Canadian horses, in Ithaca in one which had received
horses from an infected centre in Northern New York and in
Pittsburgh and Washington in stables that had just admitted horses
from infected New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d. It advanced with much greater rapidity eastward than
westward, being in the line of greatest horse traffic, the animals
being mainly raised and fitted in the West and shipped in large
numbers to the great cities near the Atlantic seaboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>4th. In the absence of this active railway traffic In horses, the
advance was most rapid through other lines. In Pa., in a number
of valleys opening to the south, the disease reversed its general
direction, and extended northward up these valleys. In Lehigh
Co., Pa., it followed the course of the canal, being carried by
horses and mules employed on the towpath. In Davidson and
Sumner Cos., Tenn., it followed the track of a circus which came
through an infected locality. It reached the Pacific coast at
Santa Barbara (not at the railway terminus at San Francisco)
having followed a mule stage route in the absence of an active,
westward progress of horses by rail.</p>

<p class='c008'>5th. The affection failed to overstep any serious gap over
which there was no movement of equine animals. It prevailed
in Victoria, B. C., in July, but, owing to a strict quarantine on
horses and mules, it failed to reach Vancouver Island. It ravaged
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in November but failed to reach
Prince Edward Island which was then ice bound and shut off
from all traffic with the mainland. It ravaged Cuba to which it
was brought by American horses landed at Havana, but no other
West Indian island was attacked. Its southward course was
finally arrested at Central America, where horses are few and
horse traffic nearly unknown.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every fact in connection with its eruption and progress agrees
perfectly with the hypothesis of transmission by contagion alone,
and taken altogether the history excludes all other causes from
being anything more than accessory. Before the days of modern
bacteriology we had ample proof that glanders, rabies, sheeppox,
lung plague, and Rinderpest were due to contagion alone as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>essential cause, and so now we have the same evidence concerning
equine influenza.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Other testimonies to Contagion.</i> Trasbot says the virulence is
“almost equal to that of Rinderpest or aphthous fever,” and
adds “all practitioners have become assured that the bringing of
an affected animal into a stable constantly introduces the malady
to the others.” Cadeac says “the diseased or infected animals
are the main channel of propagation of the malady” and again
the disease is “essentially infectious.” Friedberger and Fröhner
are more definite—“influenza which is as highly infectious as
any other disease can be produced only by infection.” Cadeac
implies nearly as much in saying: “in all the epizoötics that
have invaded Paris, the disease has been carried into the four
quarters of France by horses bought in this city. In most
regiments the malady shows itself after the arrival of horses from
remounts where it was prevailing. At Sibourne it is through
horses from St. Jean d’Angely. At Lyons it is by a horse from
Cæn. At Bourges the source was not traced but it spread from
the garrison to the whole surrounding country. The Omnibus
stables in the Rue d’Ulm were invaded when a horse was introduced
from Clichy where influenza raged.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stables</i> are fruitful sources of infection hence dealers’ horses
and horses travelling from place to place have long been objects
of just suspicion (Trasbot, etc.).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cars</i> are often infected, and spread the disease widely. (Poucet,
Salle, Trasbot, etc.).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Manure</i> is especially dangerous. Trasbot gives a number of
cases of the infection of farms, by the manure taken from the
Alfort Veterinary College, and other infected stables in Paris.
Friedberger conveyed the disease experimentally in the manure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conveyance of the virus on the <i>clothes of attendants</i> has
been alleged by Friedberger and Fröhner, and considering that
it has been noted to pass over intervals of about half a mile without
the intervention of any horse, it must have been wafted on
the air, or conveyed on the surface of man or non-equine beast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jensen and Clark allege that the contagium may be conveyed
to mares by <i>coition, for months</i> after the stallion has shown all
outward signs of recovery. This would be entirely in keeping
with the analogous fact in swine plague.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span><i>Inoculation.</i> Experimental inoculations have transmitted the
disease with difficulty and uncertainty. Those of Hertwig,
Nocard, Arloing, Labat, Friedberger, Trasbot, Pasteur and others
came to naught. Even the transfusion of the blood of the sick,
proved as harmless as the inoculation of the serous exudate. A
probable explanation is found in the extreme diffusibility of the
germ of equine influenza, which spreads over a city or county in
a few days, attacking practically all equine animals. Inoculation
is necessarily made at the time of the prevalence of influenza and
at such a time all horses in a wide area are likely to be suffering
from the affection. Those that are unaffected and therefore apparently
available for experiment, are the immune animals. If
they were susceptible the probability is that they would speedily
show the disease through infection drawn from another source than
the inoculation. If the inoculated animal failed to contract the disease,
and yet very shortly afterward became infected by simple
exposure, there would be some basis for alleging that inoculation
was always inoperative. Dieckerhoff, on the other hand, transmitted
the disease to healthy horses by subcutaneous and intravenous
inoculation of the blood of the sick, and the same seems to be
true of inoculations of the cultures of the cocco-bacillus by
Lignieres.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> Our knowledge of the bacteria of equine influenza
is as yet very imperfect and uncertain. Galtier and Violet found
streptococci and diplococci in the blood and tissues of cases showing
intestinal lesions, and held that they were derived from musty
fodder. Injections of infusions of such fodder into the trachea
of the horse produced broncho-pneumonia, double pleuro-pneumonia,
and at times intestinal or meningeal congestion. But
there is no proof that the malady so caused, passed with the certainty
and rapidity of equine influenza from horse to horse in the
same stable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>cocco-bacillus</i> found by Lignieres in the blood and exudate
of the patients has more plausible claims to being the specific
germ. This is an ovoid bacterium, somewhat smaller than that
of chicken cholera, and like it pigmented at the poles and clear
in the central part, a characteristic feature of the group of Pasteurella
of Trevisan. This group includes the nonmotile germs
of swine plague, the septicæmic pneumo-enteritis of sheep, wildeseuche,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and septicæmia of rabbits and chickens, as well as that
of fowl cholera; all stain easily in gentian violet and fuchsin,
and all cause some form of hemorrhagic septicæmia. The germ
is ærobic and grows best in peptonized bouillon to which a little
serum has been added. It forms, in peptonized gelatin, round
colonies, at first transparent and later opaque or milky, and
without liquefaction. The cultures when inoculated subcutaneously
proved fatal to Guinea pig, rabbit, rat, mouse, dog, cat,
sheep, pig, ox, ass, pigeon and chicken.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intravenous inoculation on the horse of 1 to 2cc. of the culture
kills in a few hours, the temperature having risen to 104° F.,
the mucosæ acquire a dull brown tint, the eyes are swollen and
weeping, enteritic colics appear, the limbs may swell and there
may be painful arthritis and jaundice. At the necropsy the
blood is black and incoagulable, the muscles as if parboiled, the
liver a deep violet, the intestinal mucosa congested, a yellowish
or reddish effusion in the pericardium and numerous petechiæ on
the serosæ.</p>

<p class='c008'>Subcutaneous inoculation causes an enormous inflammatory
œdema resulting in a sanguinolent abscess, in case the subject
survives. There are also hyperthermia (106° F.), dulness,
stupor, weakness, staggering, and congested, swollen, weeping
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intratracheal injection is harmless to the horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres finds his cocco-bacillus in the expectoration at the
outset and in the nasal and guttural forms of the disease later,
but not in the blood nor lungs after death, as it is then replaced
by streptococci, the great reproduction of which is favored by
its presence. In ordinary cases of equine influenza it is often
impossible to find the cocco-bacillus in the lung or other organs
after an illness of 8, 10 or 15 days. (Lignieres).</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres appears to have omitted the obvious test of the infection
of other horses in the same stable, from the cases produced
by his experimental cultures, so that we must still call for
more confirmatory proof. Cadeac, indeed, assures us that cultures
of cocco-bacilli taken from cases of equine influenza, are
often innocuous. Deadly as the germ cultures of Lignieres
prove, they appear to lack that element of extreme infectiousness
shown by equine influenza when the susceptible animals come
into proximity with the sick.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><i>Accessory Causes.</i> The recognition of the one essential cause
in the microbian invasion, need not exclude as accessory factors
the many unwholesome conditions which have long been
recognized as contributing to the severity of epizoötics. As the
seed requires the rich field, the rain and sunshine to bring it to
an abundant harvest so the microbe of equine influenza flourishes
best where the conditions are most favorable and the antagonisms
least.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>chill</i> which comes from a sudden extreme fall of temperature,
or the standing in a cold draught when wet or perspiring,
lays the system open to this as to other microbian invasions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>electric tension</i> preceding a thunderstorm, to which many of
the lower animals are excessively susceptible equally prepares the
system to succumb to the germs. It may here be noted that September
1872, the last days of which witnessed the start of the
great epizoötic, had no less than eleven thunderstorms, while in
September of the previous year there were but two in the vicinity
of Toronto. It is just possible that the great and frequent
electric tension, lowered the animal vitality, allowing a violent
invasion by the hitherto slumbering germ, and gave to the latter
that encreased potency which sent it forth on that year of almost
unparalleled epizoötic record.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>high barometer</i> and <i>low dew point</i> similarly affect the animal
economy and encrease receptivity to disease. Rain fell at
Toronto 16 days in September 1872 and but 8 days in September
1871.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Impurities in the air</i> whether originating in volcanic eruptions,
telluric emanations, close, filthy overcrowded buildings or compartments
or large collections of decomposing organic matter,
impair the animal vigor and lay the system open to a more
violent attack. For this among other reasons epizoötics of
equine influenza are nearly always more deadly in the closely
packed city stables than in the pure country air.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Overwork</i> and <i>poor irregular feeding</i> and <i>watering</i> pave the
way for debility, prostration and severe invasion.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sudden vicissitudes of temperature</i>, which are so common in
<i>spring</i> and <i>autumn</i>, associated as they are with the <i>shedding and
growth of the coat</i>, materially encrease susceptibility and sometimes
determine an encreased severity in the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span><i>Youth</i> has its influence, even if it means only that the system
that has never before been exposed to the poison, retains all its
native susceptibility, and has none of that acquired immunity
which comes from a previous exposure to the virus and successful
resistance.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Acquired immunity</i> must of course be reckoned with. After a
non-fatal attack this is usually to be relied on for several years or
even for the rest of the lifetime, yet it varies with the individual
animals, and, under the baleful combination of a specially potent
germ and strongly conducive accessory causes, it may become
worn out in a year. Yet the older horses can always be
trusted to show a large measure of this immunity, so that in the
absence of extraordinary epizoötics it is mainly the young that
suffer, and it is only when a country has had no general invasion
for a length of time, or when the germ has acquired an unusual
pathogenic potency, or when these two conditions conjoin, that the
invasion of the equine population becomes universal, as it virtually
was in the United States and Canada in 1872–3. Under other
circumstances the germ, temporarily shorn of its power, lingers
in city and dealers stables, biding its time until circumstances
become more favorable for a new general outbreak.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immunity largely explains the comparative mildness of the
last cases in any particular locality. The more susceptible animals
are attacked first and most severely, while the partially
immune ones, which for a time resist, throw off the <a id='t123'></a>disease with
greater readiness. The explanation has been sought in a lessening
potency of the germ, but though this may hold true of some
cases, it manifestly does not apply when slight lingering cases
only are left in one locality, and the disease is advancing over the
neighboring state with all its original force and vigor.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> This appears to vary within certain limits. When
during an epizoötic a sick horse is brought into a new locality and
stable, other cases usually develope in from one to three days.
Trasbot gives examples of one day, Salle, Cadeac and others of
two, others claim four, seven and even, exceptionally, fifteen
days. One reason for an apparently prolonged incubation may
be found in the seclusion of the germs in the alimentary canal, so
that they escape only when passed with the fæces. The pathogenic
potency of individual germs, and the varying susceptibility
of the animals exposed must also be taken into account.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span><i>Symptoms.</i> Equine influenza is liable to show a special predilection
for a given set of organs in different epizoötics, so that
we find descriptions of the different forms as independent types or
even separate diseases: as the <i>catarrhal form</i>, <i>thoracic form</i>,
<i>abdominal form</i>, <i>bilious form</i>, <i>nervous form</i>, <i>pink eye</i>, <i>infectious
cellulitis</i>, and <i>rheumatic influenza</i>. These forms may, however,
appear in different subjects in the same epizoötic, and when they
are not due to complications, may be looked on as a concentration
of the morbid processes on one class of organs rather than
another.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Initial pathognomonic symptoms.</i> Certain prominent and striking
symptoms are so constantly present in the earlier part of the
disease that they may be held as virtually diagnostic. These are
the <i>suddenness of attack</i>, the <i>anorexia</i>, the <i>profound early
prostration and weakness</i>, the <i>high temperature</i>, <i>the swelling and
watering of the eyes</i>, and the specially <i>brownish red coloration of
the conjunctiva and other visible mucosæ</i>. The attack may come
on with almost lightning rapidity. The animal which yesterday,
or it may be but an hour or two ago, appeared to be in the most
vigorous health and spirits, is found with pendant head, resting
perhaps on the manger, ears drooping, eyelids swollen and half
closed, epiphora, conjunctiva of a brownish red or violet, lips
loose and drooping, and one or two legs partially flexed, while
the body is balanced on the others. The patient is indisposed to
move, and when compelled to walk may sway and stagger from
nervous and muscular weakness. The arched back, cracking
limbs, and their stiff, rigid movement further indicate the suffering
in muscles or joints or both. Appetite is greatly impaired or lost,
thirst marked, and hyperthermia 102° to 105° or upward. Sneezing,
cough or symptoms of some other special localization may be
present, but the above occurring in a number of horses at once,
without appreciable climatic cause, when one or two new horses
have been very recently acquired, or when influenza has been
prevailing in the vicinity or in a neighboring place, will usually
stamp the nature of the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cadeac considers the sudden attack, high fever, and profound
nervous prostration and stupor as the manifestations of the uncomplicated
disease, while the localizations in the lungs, bronchia,
pleura, liver, bowels, etc., are indications of complications by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>germs of other diseases, which find the debilitated influenza system
especially open to attack. The <i>fever</i> which always sets in
early may be little above the normal in mild cases, and may
reach 107° or 108° F. in the more severe ones. It may last thus
for five or six days and then rather suddenly descend to near the
normal. In other cases it descends a little daily, the lowest
temperature for the day being seen in the morning. Shivering
is often nonexistent or passes unperceived.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>pulse</i> does not usually encrease in ratio with the temperature.
It may be at first only 40 or 50 per minute, though later,
and especially with extensive disease of important organs, it may
reach 60, 70, 80 or even 100. It usually lacks in firmness and
force, even when the heart beats forcibly, being soft, somewhat
compressible, and often irregular in successive beats, the weakest
corresponding to the last part of the inspiratory act, or when
the lungs are full and the heart compressed. The <i>heart</i> impulse
behind the left elbow is usually forcible and may show variation
in rhythm or even intermissions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mild <i>catarrhal symptoms of the nose and throat</i> are usually
present, the discharge being at first serous and later muco-purulent.
As a rule this is complicated with more or less bronchitis,
but this does not indicate anything serious. Acceleration of the
breathing, sneezing, and cough are present. Cough may be at
first nervous, husky and paroxysmal, but later as the discharge
is established it assumes a looser, mucous character. It is liable
to be roused by excitement, by drinking cold water, by inhalation
of dust, or by giving medicine. In connection with these symptoms
there are some indications that the digestive organs are
involved. The pharyngeal and submaxillary glands may be
swollen and tender. If the subject has been seized just after a
full meal, there may be slight tympany, and in any case, the
fæces are passed in small balls, a few at a time, hard and with a
baked or glistening surface. These may have an unusually strong
or heavy odor, and laxatives are liable to act with dangerous
energy. The urine is scanty and high colored, sometimes icteric.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such mild attacks, which constitute the majority, improvement
may be noted as early as the fourth day, and a prompt recovery
follows.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>With extensive <i>thoracic lesions</i>, the symptoms are much more
severe and the danger greatly enhanced. These may occur in
any patient, but there appears to be a special predisposition in
the young and still very susceptible animals, in those crowded
together in close, badly aired buildings, in the overworked,
poorly fed or in any way debilitated subject, and in horses that
have been especially excited and exposed, as by railway travel.</p>

<p class='c008'>In exceptional cases <i>congestion of the lungs</i> may be so acute as
to lead to speedy death, and the objective symptoms do not differ
greatly from those of ordinary cases of this condition, if we except
the very high temperature in influenza, associated as it is
with the fact of the epizoötic prevalence of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>pneumonic</i> cases the lesions are usually double and have a
tendency to develop toward the lower borders of the lungs, just
behind the elbow or farther back, and less frequently in the
centre of the organ. It may be impossible to detect crepitation,
but sounds of distant organs (heart beats, bronchial blowing, intestinal
rumbling) are heard with unwonted clearness over the
consolidated parts. A mucous râle can usually be detected behind
the shoulder blade, along the line of the larger bronchia.
Percussion sounds may be indefinite, as the area of consolidated
lung is usually small in ratio with the hyperthermia. The area
of flatness in ordinary fibrinous pneumonia is usually much
greater with a high fever, and if the lesions are on one side only,
right or left, it is still more suggestive. The crepitation too in
pneumonia is significant. When the pulmonary lesions are extensive
by reason of œdema, a marked infiltration may often be
noted on the lower surface of the trunk or in the limbs as well.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pleuritic</i> symptoms may show in the same connection. The
breathing becomes more hurried and shorter, friction sound may
be heard but it is very transient and soon superseded by an absolute
flatness on percussion, rising to a definite horizontal line,
representing the boundary of the effusion in the lower third or half
of the chest, and usually rising to the same height on both sides.
Tenderness of the intercostal spaces may or may not be present.
As the disease advances creaking sounds may be heard from the
stretching of the consolidated false membranes. The combination
of double pleuro-pneumonia constitutes a very fatal type of the
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The symptoms of <i>pericarditis</i> and of cardiac disorder usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>accompany those of pleurisy. The tumultuous heart beats, often
associated with soft, weak or even rapid pulse, and later, a deadening
or muffling of heart sounds, as in hydropericardium are
characteristic when present. With <i>endocarditis</i> the early tumultuous
heart beats, with small weak pulse, irregular and sometimes
intermittent, become complicated by a blowing or hissing murmur
with the first heart-sound. In such cases clots of blood are liable
to form in connection with the valves, and may cause sudden and
early death. When the heart is involved the tendency to extensive
infiltration of limbs and lower aspect of the trunk is much
enhanced. (See <i>diagnosis</i> for table of phenomena in influenza,
fibrinous pneumonia and contagious pneumonia respectively).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms</i> of digestive disorder are usually in evidence. Even
in the thoracic forms the mouth is dry, hot, and has an offensive
odor; the tongue coated above, has often red margins and tip;
it may even be yellowish; the gums may be swollen and dark
red or violet especially around the incisors; mastication may be
slow and unwilling; the pharynx maybe swollen; the pharyngeal
and submaxillary lymph glands may be tumid and tender; and
swallowing may be difficult.</p>

<p class='c008'>Congestions of the stomach and intestines are indicated by inappetence,
sometimes flatulence, passage of flatus, constipation
with small, round, mucous-coated balls passed in small numbers,
and by slight transient colics, pawing, looking at the flanks, and
retraction of the abdomen. The retention of bile and destruction
of blood elements are indicated in a deeper yellow of the conjunctiva
and visible mucosæ, and in a yellow, brown or red color
of the urine. There may be tenderness of the abdomen, but this,
like the colics, is moderate, the senses being blunted by the
attendant stupor which is usually even greater than in the
thoracic forms. Urination may become frequent with straining,
and the urine may become turbid, opaque, with flocculi of cystic
epithelium and mucus, and even albumen. In from three to five
days diarrhœa supervenes, the fæces becoming soft, pulpy, watery,
glairy or bloody, and escaping through a permanently dilated
sphincter. The diarrhœa may alternate with periods of torpor or
complete inactivity, otherwise tenesmus of the rectum is marked.
The exposed rectal mucosa is congested, of a deep red or
it may be of a dark violet hue. Eversion is not unknown.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>In the worst cases death may ensue by the third or fourth day,
but in others the diarrhœa is critical and heralds an improvement
which goes on to a speedy recovery. In still other cases the
bowel troubles continue, the fever does not give way and the privation
of food and rapid metamorphosis of tissue produce steady
emaciation and fatal marasmus.</p>

<p class='c008'>A striking feature of the gastro-intestinal disease is the extraordinary
susceptibility to laxatives. So much is this the case
that I have known of two drachms of aloes proving fatal by superpurgation
in a large, mature Percheron horse. It is never safe to
use laxatives in equine influenza until one has ascertained whether
in the special form of the epizoötic in question the gastro-intestinal
organs are or are not especially involved.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Disorders of the eye</i> are so common or constant as to have procured
for certain epizoötics the name of <i>pink eye</i>. They set in
suddenly, and equally in both eyes, with infiltration of the lids
and particularly of the mucosa which is of a more or less deep
red, and may bulge between the margins of the eyelids, (chemosis).
The flow of tears is profuse, seropurulent matter accumulates
at the canthi and in the lachrymal sacs, vision is impaired
and there is intolerance of light. The cornea becomes
bluish, cloudy or milky white, with a red zone around its margin
and, above all, on the adjacent sclerotic. In some cases the
aqueous humor becomes turbid or flocculent, and the iris changes
its clear, healthy dark lustre for a dull brown or yellow tint.
The tension of the globe may be materially encreased. They are
readily distinguished from recurrent ophthalmia by the attendant
weakness, stupor and hyperthermia, and by their non-recurrence
in case the patient survives.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>nervous symptoms</i> are especially manifest in the sudden
seizure, great prostration, extreme weakness, profound stupor or
lassitude, the staggering gait, in bad cases, insensibility to voice,
slap or, it may be, even to the whip, the rigidity of the loins,
their insensibility to pinching, the difficulty of turning in a short
circle, or of backing. The high fever, disproportionate to the appreciable
local lesions, and its sudden improvement at the critical
period, the excessive weariness and the disposition to lie down
contrary to the habit of other inflammatory chest diseases are
further indications.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>This may go on to coma, there may be more or less complete
anorexia, muscular trembling, paresis, especially of the hind
limbs, or delirious manifestations indicating meningitis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Rheumatoid attacks of the muscles and joints</i> usually appear in
the advanced stages of the disease, but may appear earlier. They
may occur in any latitude but seem to be especially common in
cold, damp, inclement northern regions, and at seasons when
climatic vicissitudes are sudden and extreme. These may appear
suddenly and disappear with equal rapidity, or they may last for a
time during and even after an apparent recovery in other respects.
When the joints are involved they usually become engorged with
exudates in the synovial membranes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lameness</i> in either <i>fore</i> or <i>hind limb</i> may assume an <i>intermittent
type</i> developed by exercise and subsiding with rest, evidently
bespeaking local arterial embolism, and in such cases it is likely
to persist for months.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tendency to <i>transudations</i> and <i>dropsical effusions</i> is common
in severe cases, showing especially in the filling of the legs, but
in certain epizoötics, these become strikingly prevalent and have
secured for such a special name (<i>epizoötic cellulitis</i>). Apart from
the limbs these affect particularly the inferior surface of the chest
and abdomen. The swellings are not necessarily hot nor painful
nor petechiated as in petechial fever, yet they may merge into
that affection or they may become phlegmonous and develop
abscess.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Complications</i> of many kinds are to be looked for, pregnant
mares may <i>abort</i>; <i>laminitis</i> may set in; the microbes of <i>strangles</i>,
<i>contagious pneumonia</i>, <i>cerebro-spinal meningitis</i>, <i>septicæmia</i>,
<i>pyæmia</i>, etc., may take occasion to attack the debilitated system,
and thus complex diseases and manifestations are developed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Morbid Anatomy.</i> The lesions may predominate in different
organs in different subjects and successive epizoötics. It is a
protean disease and may expend its main energy on any one of a
number of different organs or systems of organs.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the slighter cases the lesions are often largely confined to
the anterior part of the respiratory organs. The <i>fauces</i>, <i>pharynx</i>,
<i>larynx</i>, <i>guttural pouches</i> and <i>nasal mucosa</i> are tumified, congested,
red and covered with mucous, and this condition may extend
down to the bronchia. In such cases the <i>blood</i> is normal or may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>coagulate with undue readiness and firmness. The pharyngeal
and intermaxillary lymph glands are red and congested in their
outer zone.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the more severe cases the <i>alterations in the blood</i> are perhaps
the most constant of the morbid features. The blood is fluid and
incoagulable, or the clot is soft, diffluent and black, the red
globules are crenated or broken up, and show little tendency to
adhere in rouleaux. The escaped hæmatoidin accumulates in
masses in the serum in crystalline forms, giving it a high staining
power when a line is drawn with it on white paper. Fatty
globules also float in the mass. The leucocytes are relatively very
much encreased and the red globules diminished. Dieckerhoff
found 30,000 and Trasbot 40,000 leucocytes in a cubic millimetre.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diffluence is not constant. Blood drawn in the earlier
stages of the disease, coagulates with extraordinary firmness, influenced,
doubtless, by the encrease of the leucocytes, the disintegration
of the blood globules, and the liberation of globulins.
This serves also to partially explain the early and sudden deaths
from coagula in the heart and large vessels, which are occasionally
met with. Such clots in the heart are often found adherent to
the valvular or ventricular endocardium which at such points
shows cloudy swelling, thickening, cell proliferation and even
encreased vascularity and granular elevations.</p>

<p class='c008'>In advanced cases, however, the prominent features are usually
acidity, blackness, and incoagulability of the blood, its resistance
to oxygen, altered and broken down red globules, free coloring
matter, relative encrease of white cells, and, if necropsy has been
delayed, the abundance of septic microbes (cocci and bacilli).
Petechiæ are abundant on the serosæ especially on the pericardium.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions of the alimentary mucosa</i> are very constant. There
may be stomatitis, with tumid follicles and even ulcers (Kowalavsky).
In the <i>stomach</i> the <i>right sac</i> has its mucosa thickened,
softened, red, congested, petechiated and discolored. The summits
of the folds may be ulcerated (Labat). Similar lesions are
presented in the <i>small intestines</i>. The agminated glands may
show many rounded elevations, with or without open discharging
follicles. The mucosa is covered with a muco-purulent material.
Otherwise, the small intestines, like the stomach, are usually empty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>The <i>large intestines</i> present similar lesions, the nodular elevations
often representing the solitary glands, and the masses of ingesta
are likely to be dry and indurated, in the earlier stages or
semiliquid in old standing cases. The <i>peritoneum</i> may be congested,
petechiated and at points infiltrated and usually contains
a reddish serum in variable quantity. The <i>mesenteric glands</i> are
more or less enlarged and congested.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>liver</i> shows more or less congestion as in other infectious
diseases localized in the bowels. It usually has a parboiled appearance,
and yellowish gray areas of necrosis may be manifest,
or again, fatty degeneration may be present. Petechiæ, and even
small blood clots may be found on or beneath the capsule. The
<i>pancreas</i>, and, still more, the <i>spleen</i> may be the seat of congestion
or engorgement but this is far from constant.</p>

<p class='c008'>The capsule of the <i>kidney</i> may be petechiated or elevated at
points by serous exudate or extravasation. The surface of the
organ and of sections show a mottling with darker and lighter
areas, and petechiæ and patches of congestion may be found on
the bladder and urethra.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>nervous centres</i> exceptionally show meningeal congestions,
and exudations, and petechiæ as has been noted of other serosæ.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lesions of the <i>eye</i> may be confined to the mucosa, or they may
extend to the membrane of the aqueous humor, the iris, or even
the deeper structures.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other lesions such as <i>laminitis</i>, <i>bursitis</i>, <i>arthritis</i>, like those
attendant on <i>abortion</i> need no special description.</p>

<p class='c008'>When <i>pulmonary lesions</i> are extensive, the bronchial mucosa
is not only softened, opaque and covered with a serous, or muco-purulent
discharge, but deeply congested and petechiated.
When the chest is opened there is usually an effusion, pale straw,
red or bloody and more abundant than in contagious pneumonia.
False membranes may exist and show a blackish tint from extravasated
blood. The lung fails to collapse and shows on the
surface and throughout its substance petechiæ and small black
infarctions. In some instances the whole lung is blood gorged,
black, almost jelly like, as in acute congestion. In others these
are limited infiltrations, concentrated especially in the anterior
and lower parts, and almost invariably affecting both right and
left lungs. The infiltration is circumscribed in area in comparison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>with the attendant fever and constitutional disturbance,
resembling in this respect, the lesions of contagious pneumonia.
It differs however in having a greater tendency to liquid infiltration
of the connective tissue, and but for the lack of such tissues
in the horse’s lung it would tend to approximate to the lesions of
lung plague in cattle. It shows a distinct thickening of the
interlobular septa, a tendency to extension to the pleura, and
to issue in pleural and subpleural infiltration, and to a more
copious effusion into the pleural cavity than in either fibrinous or
contagious pneumonia. The lung tissue may be granular and
hepatized, but far more frequently it is only splenized, the lung
being the seat of a bloody infiltration, yet retaining much of its
elasticity and coherence. Portions may be infarcted and black
and large areas may have a pale or parboiled appearance, and
gangrene is by no means uncommon.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> This is based largely on the suddenness of the
attack, its epizoötic character, the numbers attacked in rapid succession,
and over a large area as contrasted with contagious
pneumonia, the sudden and extreme prostration and weakness,
the swelling, watering and discoloration of the eyes, the mildness
of the average case, the congestion of the upper air passages, and
in the mild cases a comparative immunity of the lungs, the irritability
or congestion of the gastro-intestinal mucosa, and the history
of the case:—the arrival of the infected horses within a few
days from an infected place, or coming through infected channels,
or the attack of new arrivals in a previously infected stable, or
the known advance of the disease towards the place where the
patients are, will usually serve to mark the true nature of the
affection.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a help to correct diagnosis we give below some of the prominent
conditions and phenomena of the three forms of lung disease
known as <i>fibrinous pneumonia</i>, <i>contagious pneumonia</i>, and the
<i>pneumonia of equine influenza</i>:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis.</i> <i>Mortality.</i> As usually met with and under favorable
conditions, equine influenza is a mild disease. In 1872 when
the disease, sweeping the continent and hardly sparing an equine
animal, might be assumed to have reached its maximum, the
actual deaths varied from 2 per cent. in country districts to 7 per
cent. in large cities. The same holds for Europe where Friedberger
and Fröhner gives 4 to 5 per cent. Früs (Denmark) 1 per
cent., Aureggio (Italy) 3 per cent., Siedamgrotzky 10 per cent.
Much depends on conditions: In horses infected in transit on a
long railroad journey it may be 100 per cent. and in fat dealer’s
horses, out of condition for active work it usually reaches a high
figure. If the patients are kept at work the complications and
mortality run very high. The same applies to debilitated animals
kept in close, foul, ill-aired stables, or reduced by exhausting
or long standing diseases. The very young and the senile
suffer more than animals in middle life and vigorous condition.
Finally the parts invaded have a controlling effect. The milder
cases affecting the upper air passages only, nearly all recover, in
those showing abdominal lesions the indications are still favorable;
while with double pulmonary and pleural lesions the patient is
too often in a hopeless condition. Brain lesions are almost
equally redoubtable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The actual money losses, in an epizoötic of influenza, are more
in the way of the loss of work and the complete stagnation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>trade in all departments, than in the number of deaths. Yet
even in this sense it may prove more ruinous than would a disease
having a less universal sway, though far more fatal to the animals
attacked.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> A disease like this, which tends to spontaneous
and perfect recovery, needs mainly dietetic and hygienic care in
the vast majority of cases. Rest is a prime consideration in a
pure genial atmosphere. In the summer season, in the absence
of rainstorms, an open air life, at pasture is the best. Shelter
must be had in case of storms, and in the cold season a clean,
sweet, roomy well-aired loose box, with a sunny exposure, is
important. Clothing, bandages, blankets and even hoods may be
required if there is any tendency to chill. Food should be laxative,
cooling and of easy digestion. Bran mashes, scalded oats
or barley, ensilage, roots, potatoes, apples, fresh grass or scalded
hay may be suggested. Milk has been strongly advocated, from
twelve to fifteen quarts a day, and linseed tea as being especially
adapted to the irritable stomach and bowels. Food should be
given often, in small quantities so as not to destroy the appetite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Costiveness is best met by injections of water, blood warm, or
if there is much hyperthermia, of cold water. This latter stimulates
the peristalsis more actively and at the same time lowers the
temperature. By unloading the large intestines it removes irritants,
without danger of encrease of congestion or diarrhœa.</p>

<p class='c008'>If anything more is wanted for these mild cases, small doses of
stimulating diuretics or diaphoretics may be given. Sweet spirits
of nitre ½ oz. or liquor of acetate of ammonia 2 oz. may be
given twice a day, the latter in the drinking water or gruel. In
the absence of these saltpeter ½ oz, or potassium acetate ½ oz.
may be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the more <i>severe cases</i> more active treatment is resorted to, but
in all cases one should avoid measures that tend to greatly depress
the vital powers and especially the circulation. Heroic
treatment has been all but universally condemned and yet
Trasbot claims to have had excellent results from a moderate
venesection (2–5 qts.) in strong, muscular, well conditioned animals.
The blood became more fibrinous, the general symptoms
improved and complications were far less marked. During
twenty years, in a large number of cases, it had constantly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>same results, restoring appetite, opening the closed eye, imparting
new life, lowering temperature, and checking congestions. The
results were best in all cases when it was employed early, but
they were almost equally good when later congestions set in, or
when the ordinary inflammatory localizations were advancing, and
he found the measure hurtful only when, in the advanced stages, the
animal was worn out, and destitute of all power of recuperation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Antipyretics</i> have been lauded and decried, and it is doubtless
best to use them with due discrimination and caution. Acetanilid,
the agent in most common use, is a powerful cardiac depressant,
and in this disease the heart is often already dangerously weak.
Yet in cases with very high temperature, seriously threatening
life, acetanilid in doses of 2 drams, repeated every second or
third hour until the temperature falls, and thereafter twice or
thrice daily, for a day or two, may save the patient. Similarly,
where there are indications of violent headache (drooping head,
eyelids and ears, congested and watery conjunctiva, stupor or irresponsiveness)
a dose or two of acetanilid with the same amount
of sodium bromide will often give material relief. The general suffering
and disorder attendant on the cephalalgia, if allowed to continue,
prove a direct bar to improvement, and endanger complications
that might otherwise be escaped. On the other hand,
there is constant danger from too large doses, or a too long continued
use of acetanilid in influenza. Phenacetin may be substituted
in 2 dram doses, the action being somewhat more prompt
and transient. As less dangerous than the coal tar antipyretics,
we may fall back on such agents as sodium salicylate, ½ to 1 oz.,
or sulphate of quinia, 20 grs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elimination of toxins and waste products is to be secured and
this is more safely conducted by the kidneys or skin than by the
irritable alimentary canal. Plenty of pure cold water is one of
the best and simplest resorts. Aside from this, where there is
much hyperthermia, bicarbonate of potash or soda will serve the
various purposes of an antidote to the acid blood, an eliminant
and an antithermic. Under the same circumstances saltpeter may
be resorted to in ½ oz. doses twice daily. When, however, the
heart is weak it is better to employ ammoniacal or etherial diuretics:—spirits
of nitrous ether, 1 oz. or liquor of acetate of ammonia,
2 to 4 ozs. By combining these with extract of belladonna
and camphor a fairly standard prescription may be prepared.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Inhalations of warm water vapor, rising from hot water or a
hot mash in a bucket, over one end of which a bottomless bag is
drawn, while the other end receives the nose of the horse, will
greatly relieve the irritation and the cough. It can be made
even more soothing by introducing a little alcohol, eucalyptol,
menthol, camphor, poppy-heads, or other anodyne. Or the water
vapor may be set free in a close stall from a boiling tea-kettle or
a steam pipe, and an admixture of sulphurous acid made by burning
a few pinches of sulphur, more or less according to the size
and closeness of the stall. If the stall is tight enough a steam
bath may be given with much profit in the early stages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Counter irritants applied to the throat, or, if need be, to the
breast and sides of the chest will often give material relief, acting
as derivatives and probably also by modifying the globulins in
the exudate and thus influencing the course of the disease. In
case of sore throat of a very high type it may be best to apply a
compress or poultice, or even a piece of sheepskin for a day or
two, until, by antithermics, cooling diuretics and soothing inhalations,
the severity of the inflammation has abated. The common
mustard pulp made with tepid water, rubbed in, and covered by
paper, may be applied for an hour; or the <i>soap liniment</i> (soap
6 ozs., camphor 3 ozs., and proof spirit, liquor ammonia and linseed
oil aa 1 pint) may be rubbed on repeatedly; or a blister of
cantharides may be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>ophthalmia</i> may be treated by a moist atmosphere, a few
drops twice daily of a solution of atropine beneath the lids, a
similar treatment with pyoktanin, (1:1000), or a solution of
mercuric chloride (1:2000).</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of <i>gastro-intestinal inflammation</i> elimination is to be
sought by ⅓d the usual laxative dose, supplemented if need be,
by injections. Half a pint of olive oil with 20 grs. calomel will
usually be well borne. Counter irritants may be applied to the
abdomen, and the bowels must be carefully watched and any inactivity
or derangement corrected. A slight diarrhœa is not to be
too hastily checked as it may serve at once to eliminate offensive
matters and subdue mucous inflammation. Solutions of flax seed,
gum, or slippery elm in the drinking water may serve a good end.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of <i>cardiac weakness</i> with intermittent or irregular
pulse, hurried breathing, and an undue contrast between the violence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of the heart action and the weakness of the pulse, circulatory
stimulants are called for. Digitalis 10 grains twice daily,
strophanthus tincture 1½ dr., strophanthin subcutem ¼ grain,
caffeine 5 grains, veratrine ⅒th grain, or strychnia 2 grains.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Nervous symptoms</i> will exceptionally demand the application of
cold water or even ice or snow to the head, with counterirritants
to the sides of the neck or chest, and the internal use of bromides,
iodides, chloral or other nerve sedative.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other complications must be treated according to their indications.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the skin becomes cooler and more moist, and the pulse
slower and fuller, a tonic and stimulating treatment may be desirable.
Gentian 4 drs., saltpeter 4 drs., sal-ammoniac 2 drs. may
be given night and morning, or in case of great debility ammonia
carbonate may replace the sal-ammoniac. Or the gentian may be
replaced by nux vomica, and the ammoniacal preparations by
alcoholic ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>When prostration becomes extreme and stimulants and bitters
appear inadequate, transfusion of blood from a healthy horse may
save the patient’s life, or a normal salt solution sterilized may
be introduced into the vein.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first method is accomplished through a caouchouc tube
with a short tube of silver inserted in each end; the jugular
groove of each horse is washed and disinfected, and the vein
opened; the tube disinfected with a salicylic acid solution, and
cleared out with boiled water is inserted upward into the vein of
the sound horse, and when the blood begins to flow the other end
is inserted downward into the vein of the sick one. In this way
the blood is allowed to flow from the one to the other, the finger
being kept on the pulse of the patient to detect any faltering,
which like heaving up of the head or rolling of the eyes, may be
taken to indicate undue arterial tension, or disturbed brain circulation,
and should be the signal for an arrest of the flow. To
effect this, pinch the tube in the centre, and wait a minute or so;
if the symptoms subside the current may be reopened and a little
more carefully admitted, but if not the tube may be withdrawn
and the wounds pinned up.</p>

<p class='c008'>The normal salt solution, .6 per cent., is sterilized by boiling,
and placed in a sterilized vessel where it is allowed to cool to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>body temperature; then a caouchouc tube furnished with a silver
tube at one end and sterilized as for transfusion of blood, is filled
with the solution and the vessel containing the latter having been
placed at a level higher than the patient, the tube is used as a
syphon. When the liquid flows in full stream the silver tube is
inserted downward into the jugular of the patient and the liquid
is allowed to flow in, subject to the same precautions as regards
sudden blood tension as in the case of the transfusion of blood.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> No country appears to have attempted the absolute
exclusion of the disease or the extinction of the germ by a
compulsory quarantine and disinfection. The nearest approach
to this is in Prussia where in the event of an outbreak of equine
influenza, the official veterinarians and police authorities must
send in reports to be published in the official papers and communicated
to the directors of government breeding studs and to
the army authorities. We have here the germ of an effective
system of extinction, for if those in charge of government horses
in an infected country can protect them against infection, much
more could such protection be secured by putting an end to the
infection which is now allowed to remain generalized. Moreover
in our great outbreak of 1872–3, when germ-potency and
all but universal susceptibility were so remarkable, effective
quarantine showed the most signal successes, in the resulting
immunity of Vancouver’s Island, Prince Edward Island, the
whole of the West Indies except Cuba, Central and South
America, and isolated districts in Mexico.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sanitary police in this disease has been abandoned mainly because
the virus is so diffusive on the air that quarantine must be
more than usually comprehensive to prevent extension of
infection, and because the disease is fatal only in a small
percentage of cases, so that the loss is apparently minimized.
But a panzoötic like that of 1872–3, prostrating 1,000,000 horses,
asses and mules in the United States for one to two weeks, and
paralyzing the agriculture and commerce of the continent for
that length of time, may well make one hesitate to supinely accept
for all time an evil, which, experience has shown, can be
circumscribed and stamped out. When horse owners, legislatures
and veterinarians can be educated up to the needs of the case our
yearly local losses from equine influenza, and the occasional all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>pervading epizoötics of this disease can probably be abolished by
the extinction of the germ on the Continent. To achieve this
result an immediate large outlay would be well spent. In a new
generation, or a new century perhaps, this desirable object may
be achieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile the individual owner can do something to secure a
partial protection. On farms and in barracks the animals may be
secluded from all other equine animals during the local prevalence
of the disease. Men, dogs, and wild animals can be
similarly excluded. Litter, fodder, bags, clothing, manure,
vehicles, etc., from infected stables and places must be carefully
guarded against. Newly purchased animals, carried in any
public conveyance, or kept or fed in any public yard or stable
must be quarantined at a considerable distance from others, and
treated by disinfectant sponging and fumigation before they are
allowed to mingle with other equine animals. Stables where the
disease has occurred must be thoroughly disinfected, together
with all manure made during the epizoötic and for some time
thereafter.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>EPIZOOTIC CELLULITIS: PINK EYE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Williams follows a popular fashion in describing under the
above names an affection which may be only a form of equine influenza,
but which may be named by itself until its true place
can be defined by proof of its actual pathogenic microörganism.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beside the general constitutional disturbance, this condition is
distinguished by marked hyperthermia (103° to 104°), swollen,
congested, watering eyelids, cough, strong pulse becoming gradually
feeble, firmly coagulating blood, irritable bowels, painful
passage of fæces, and, above all, a frequent movement of the feet
indicative of discomfort and followed by swelling, often excessive,
of the limb or limbs, by a cutaneous and subcutaneous exudate.
These various phenomena may all be but manifestations of the
rather protean disease, equine influenza, and the cellulitis but
variations of the rheumatoid and arthritic forms which are so
common in the regular type of that disease in cold or wet climates,
or seasons. Williams claims that a prominent danger is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the formation of clots in the heart and large vessels and advocates
the free use of the salts of ammonia and potash with stimulants.
The treatment does not essentially differ from that of equine influenza
except in the call for special applications to the inflamed
eyes and infiltrated limbs.</p>

Anasarca (Fr.); Typhus: Anthrax; Dropsy of Connective Tissue;
Mal de Tete de Contagion; Coryza Gangrenosa; Malleus
Gangrenosa; Charbon Blanc; Diastashemia; Leucophlegmasia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An acute (or subacute), toxæmic, generally secondary
disease, manifested by capillary dilatation and petechiæ
on the mucosæ, skin, serosæ and elsewhere, and attended by extensive
effusions of lymph and blood into the skin and connective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>tissue, to form hot, tender, nodular, diffused, or general swellings.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The causes of petechial fever are not clearly made
out. Bacteria are found in the early exudate, but these are not
constant in kind and it is not unreasonable to suspect that these
may be results rather than causes of the lesions. On the other
hand there may be an as yet undiscovered organism present, the
products of which are capable of producing the disorder. Or the
latter may be due to a combination of the toxins of two or more.
Among the bacteria found may be named: The pus microbes,
cocci, streptococci, staphylococci, and bacilli, have been found and
adduced as causes, also diplococci, the bacillus hæmorrhagicus of
Kolb, the streptococcus of strangles, the microörganism of contagious
pneumonia and that of influenza, with a variety of others
too great and too inconstant to be accepted as proof of cause.
The fact that rarely more than one animal suffers in the same
stable at the same time might be held to oppose the idea of contagion
and of a definite organized germ.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence the theory of its causation by the presence in the system
of the toxic products of bacteria rather than the bacteria themselves.
(Dieckerhoff.) Cadeac supposes that any toxin which
causes capillary dilatation may determine the disease, and calls
attention to the fact that the injection of mallein (a vaso-dilator)
aggravates the phenomena of petechial fever and determines
enormous local exudations and engorgements. He notes further
the potent vaso-dilator action of the products of strangles, contagious
pneumonia, and influenza which are among the most frequent
antecedents of petechial fever. Dieckerhoff also looks on the
phenomena as the result of poisoning by the absorbed toxins of
the microbes of suppuration, which modify the nutritive changes
in the walls of the capillaries and determine exudations and
hæmorrhages. Zschokke thinks that there is infection of the
intima of the capillaries, with the formation of coagula. Clots
are not found, however, apart from hæmorrhages.</p>

<p class='c008'>The toxin theory receives indirect support from the absence of
the same specific lesions in simple mechanical congestion of the
capillaries and veins. Ranvier had no such results from tying
the veins of a rabbit’s ear. Roger tied the auricular veins of the
rabbit, and then cut the sensory nerves without effect: he then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>destroyed the cervical sympathetic ganglion, when there supervened
marked exudation, lasting for three days. The complete
blocking of veins by pressure or aseptic ligature, does not produce
a spreading œdema, whereas in ordinary suppurative phlebitis,
with abundance of toxins in the tissues this is a constant result.</p>

<p class='c008'>The toxin theory does not fully account for those cases that
occur suddenly, without any manifest pre-existing disease, and
as the result apparently of cold and chill. On the other hand,
it is only a very small proportion of horses exposed to the same
degree of cold and chill that contract petechial fever, and it might
well be surmised that in these few an unknown focus of suppuration
or other lesion existed prior to the chill or that toxins having
the requisite devitalizing and vaso-dilating properties had been
absorbed from fermentations in the bowels or elsewhere. The
mere exposure is harmless to the very great majority of subjects.</p>

<p class='c008'>In any case it must be accepted that the debility and impaired
local innervation, nutrition and function, that attend on the exposure
to cold and toxins must be looked on as potent contributing
causes. The predilection of the swellings for dependent parts
(limbs, venter, face) shows the influence of gravitation and congestion.
Whether there is present any special microbe which
has yet eluded discovery, but which is the main pathogenic
factor, must be left to the future to decide.</p>

<p class='c008'>In cases that appear to be due to cold or chill alone, the disease
is held to be <i>primary</i>; in those following on another affection,
<i>secondary</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the diseases on which petechial fever supervenes as a
secondary affection contagious inflammatory affections of the
lungs and air passages hold a bad preëminence. Strangles, influenza
and contagious pneumonia, about in the order named,
are especially causative factors or occasions of petechial fever.
Among the other affections on which it supervenes may be named
pharyngitis, abscess of the nasal sinuses, hepatic, renal and other
internal abscesses, acute coryza, laryngitis, or bronchitis, enteritis,
abortion, aggravated grease, suppurating wounds of the skin, infective
abrasions by harness, suppurating sores after firing, infective
arthritis with open joint, amputation of the tail, and castration.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> In certain cases these may be largely confined to petechiæ
and slight blood extravasations, which are distributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>very generally throughout the tissues, but show especially in the
skin, subcutis, mucosa and submucosa of the nose, eyes, pharynx,
guttural pouches, larynx, trachea, bronchia, mouth, stomach,
intestine, bladder, vagina and womb; also in and on the lungs,
pleura, pericardium, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, peritoneum,
pancreas, ovaries, bones, lymph glands, brain and nerves. The
largest extravasations are liable to be in the softest tissues, and in
the lungs they may reach the size of the closed fist, though
usually they vary from a mere spot up to this. The spleen is
sometimes engorged even to rupture. Beside the extravasations,
and associated with them in position, and probably largely as an
effect of them, there is more or less serous effusion infiltrating
the tissues, congestions, suppurations, degenerations, and necrotic
changes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>skin</i>, if white, and the dark skins on section, are seen to
be marked by petechiæ. The cutaneous swellings may appear on
any part, commencing with nodular thickenings varying in size
from a pea to a walnut, and merging together into extensive
elevated areas terminating abruptly at their margins in the smooth
skin. The larger and more persistent engorgements settle on
the lower aspect of the body and other dependent parts like the
limbs and face. Cracks, oozing, deep fissure, and extensive
sloughs are not uncommon. When the skin is incised it shows
serous infiltration and thickening, with spots and patches of
blood extravasation. The subcutaneous connective tissue is
similarly infiltrated and discolored, and often in the limbs, face,
and under the breast, sternum and abdomen so as to form a
tremulous gelatinoid cushion of several inches in thickness. The
capillaries may be distended to more than 20 times their normal
calibre. The exudate may extend deeply between the muscles,
and sloughs may lay these freely open and invade their substance.
The muscular tissue is mottled with petechiæ, and apart from
these it is pale, yellow, or grayish, having to some extent undergone
granular or fatty degeneration. Detachment of the perforans
and perforatus from their insertions is occasionally met
with.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>nasal mucosa</i> may show only petechiæ and circumscribed
blood staining, but in fatal cases it is more likely to present
extensive blood extravasations involving it may be the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>mucosa, and narrowing the lumen almost to complete occlusion.
Sloughing is not rare, and the resulting ulcers may extend into
the subjacent tissues, so as to penetrate the septum nasi or the
thin plate of the turbinated bone.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>buccal mucosa</i> and <i>submucosa</i> are often involved in common
with the skin of the lips, cheeks, and intermaxillary space, the
tissues being involved in one common infiltration of blood and
serum. In some cases circumscribed necrosis and ulcerations are
formed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>pharynx</i> and <i>larynx</i> infiltration of the mucosa and adjacent
parts of a deep blood red, with or without ulceration, causes
serious narrowing of the passage, that on the vocal cords threatening
suffocation. Suppuration of the pharyngeal glands and guttural
pouches is not uncommon. Alimentary matters are frequently
found in the larynx, and bronchia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beside the petechiæ and hæmorrhages in the <i>lungs</i>, œdematous
infiltration in dependent parts, hepatization, abscess, and limited
areas of necrosis are met with. The pleural sacs often contain a
sanguineous effusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>stomach</i> and <i>intestines</i> are usually more or less mottled
with petechiæ involving mucosa, serosa or muscular coat; they
are raised in rounded or irregular elevations by œdemas; or they
are the seats of more or less extensive and even perforating ulcers.
The contents of the bowels may be deeply discolored by the
escaping blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>kidneys</i> may be pale except where blood stained and
œdematous infiltration of the surrounding tissue may be marked.
Serous effusion into the peritoneum is not rare.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>eyelids</i> are often implicated, infiltrated thickened, and rigid,
and the conjunctiva, bulbar and palpebral, the seat of extensive
petechiæ.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barreau mentions extravasations on the divisions of the lumbosacral
plexus causing sudden paraplegia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Petechiæ and hæmorrhages mark endocardium, pericardium
and cardiac muscle, otherwise the muscle is pale. The blood is
sometimes in firm clot, at others diffluent or nearly incoagulable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> If hyperthermia is not already present as a feature
of the pre-existing malady it usually shows itself early, at first
slight, it may be (101° F.), and afterward rising in some cases to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>104° to 106° F., or even higher. The general symptoms are
usually those of the pre-existing disease (strangles, contagious
pneumonia, influenza, nasal catarrh, pharyngitis, bronchitis,
etc.), pursuing, it may be, a persistent course, or attended by
special toxæmic symptoms of prostration and other signs of
depression of vital functions. In some cases the hyperthermia is
either absent at this stage or overlooked. On the prostration
supervene the petechiæ on the visible mucosæ, and often also the
swellings of the skin and subcutis. One of these may be seen
before the other and it is difficult to decide whether the petechiæ
always appear first as has been claimed. Cadeac claims that when
œdema is first seen it has been preceded by petechiæ in that
tissue (skin).</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>petechiæ</i> are usually first noticed on the nasal mucosa as
fine red points, pin’s heads, or up to half an inch in diameter,
or a number of these have coalesced to form extensive patches,
and by and by to cover the entire wall. At first the mucosa is
spotted with purple, without any marked elevation of the surface,
but as the lesions extend it becomes swollen and raised at the
points of extravasation and immediately around them and oozes a
serous, sometimes a pinkish or yellow fluid. Even in the
smallest petechiæ the color is persistent and does not disappear on
pressure like the blush of the adjacent mucosa.</p>

<p class='c008'>Usually <i>cutaneous swellings</i> coincide with the petechiæ, or
appear within two days thereafter. The first manifestation is in
the form of rounded abruptly elevated nodules, about 1½ inch to
3 inches in diameter, strongly resembling the eruption of urticaria.
These show a certain predilection for the more dependent parts
of the body,—limbs, abdomen, sheath, mammæ, sternal or
pectoral region, nose, lips, face, etc.,—but they may develop on
any part or on the whole surface. Neither tenderness nor heat is
usually excessive. The swellings tend to run together so as to
form extended elevations enveloping the entire limb up to a given
point, forming a great pad under the chest and abdomen, or distending
the whole face or head so that it seems more like that of
a hippopotamus than of a horse. In such cases the lips and
nostrils become so thick and rigid that prehension is impossible,
and breathing if it can be accomplished at all is accompanied with
a marked snuffling. The swollen eyelids are closed, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>general turgid surface of the face is hard and resistant and no
longer pits on pressure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the <i>chest</i> and <i>abdomen</i> the swellings show as a continuous
pad or cushion, on one side mainly or extending across continuously
on both sides, and from the breast to between the thighs. It
usually pits on pressure, and may shed the hair and become rough
and scabby or ooze a serous fluid from the surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the limbs the swelling usually shows first on the fetlock or
pastern and gradually extends upward until it reaches the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the disease advances chaps, cracks and fissures tend to form
on the swellings, showing about the head, on the lips or on the
nose and maxilla where the noseband of the halter crosses; on the
lower part of the body where the circingle crosses, or where the
part is pressed upon in lying down, and in the limbs in the flexure
of the joints—behind the pastern, or knee or in front of the
hock. In many cases the skin and connective tissue sloughs, and
drops off exposing the muscles, the tendons or the ligaments of
the joints. In other cases the tendons are involved in the degenerative
process or necrosis and become detached from their lower
insertions so that the toe may be turned up or the fetlock pad
may come to the ground. The matrix of the hoof wall (coronary
band) may separate from the horn, leaving a gaping opening
which exudes liquid freely, and if the animal survives, the entire
hoof may be shed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In other cases, and often quite early in the disease, the swellings
may suddenly subside and disappear, with it may be, a recovery,
or, in other cases, with an exudation into the lungs or
chest, the digestive organs or abdomen. In case the lungs are
attacked, there is hurried oppressed breathing merging into
dyspnœa or asphyxia. In case the bowels suffer there are colicy
pains more or less acute, with much constitutional disturbance,
marked prostration and serous or bloody diarrhœa. These mostly
prove speedily fatal. Less redoubtable are those cases in which
the swellings alternately subside or moderate, and reappear or
increase, without implication of the internal organs. The absence
of internal lesions and the moderation and intermissions, of the
external ones, give good hope of the preservation of the vitality of
the tissues and of recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span><i>Course and Duration.</i> These vary much with the severity of
the case. In subacute and tardy cases with few petechiæ and
restricted swelling in the limbs, the symptoms become remittent
and recovery finally takes place after one or two months. In
other cases the morbid phenomena which developed rapidly may
subside as quickly and recovery occurs in a few days. In the
more typical case the visible lesions may encrease or remain
stationary for one, two or three weeks and then terminate in
death or recovery. In the most violent types death may occur
within forty-eight hours. The average duration of the affection
is found to be about 16 days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Differential Diagnosis.</i> In typical cases of petechial fever,
diagnosis is easy. The supervention on a protracted or debilitating
disease of the respiratory passages of an access of hyperthermia,
and marked prostration, with the appearance on the
nasal or other mucosa of petechiæ and swellings of a dark red
color throughout, and of cutaneous swellings in the form of
nodular elevations and more extended salient patches, having a
tendency to ooze blood or serum, to crack and fissure is virtually
pathognomonic.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Acute glanders</i> may resemble it but lacks the extended sloughs
of petechial fever, and the nasal ulcers that form in glanders are
on a yellowish base and periphery, whereas the purpura ulcer is
on an uniformly dark red base, and without the elevated margin
seen in glanders. In cases of doubt the mallein test is not available
as the purpuric patient is already fevered, or liable to be so at
any moment, and any wound in such a subject will give rise to
extensive swelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>In glanders the nodular submaxillary enlargement is almost
pathognomonic and still more so if the facial lymphatic vessels are
thickened (corded) and both symptoms fail in purpura. In cutaneous
glanders with swollen joints or limbs the attendant pain
is much more severe, and the farcy buds, forming on the thickened
and indurated lymph vessels, bursting and discharging an
albuminoid fluid like oil have no counterpart in petechial fever.
In cases of doubt the search for the glander bacillus, and above
all the inoculation of a male Guinea pig in the flank and the discovery
of the bacillus mallei in the resulting exudate and diseased
testicle will decide.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>From <i>anthrax</i> and <i>emphysematous anthrax</i> petechial fever is
distinguished by the absence of the large bacilli of these respective
diseases from the exudate. It is not communicable, like anthrax,
to the sheep, Guinea pig and rabbit, and does not crackle on
manipulation, like emphysematous anthrax. The swellings are
much more generally diffused than in anthrax and the hyperthermia
much less.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Urticaria</i> furnishes a skin eruption which may be indistinguishable
from the earlier skin lesions of petechial fever, but these
lesions are not associated with the petechiæ in the nasal and other
mucosæ, and the swellings do not advance to great sanguineous
engorgements, cracks, fissures, necrosis, and deep and extensive
sores as in purpura. Urticaria is, moreover, usually traceable to
some digestive disturbance and fault in feeding.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Malignant œdema</i> is usually confined to the seat of the inoculation
wound and an extension around that, the exudate is very
watery and may be mixed with fetid gas bubbles, so as to crepitate
slightly, and it contains an abundance of its specific, round
ended bacillus, often in chain form. The carcass putrefies with
great rapidity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Horse pox</i> affecting the pastern and limb with attendant swelling
is distinguished by the absence of petechiæ on the mucosæ,
and by the formation on the affected part of little pea-like papules,
which early exude an abundant liquid, the concretion of which
on the hairs forms a remarkable yellowish encrustation, embedded
in the angry red sores beneath.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality.</i> <i>Prognosis.</i> The mortality has generally averaged
about 50 per cent. Much, however, depends on the violence of
the attack, and the reduced and worn out condition of the patient.
The most hopeful cases are those in which the temperature
remains near the normal, the strength and appetite are well sustained,
the swellings are comparatively slight, and there is no
indication of any internal complication. The unpromising symptoms
are: persistent high temperature; complete anorexia; great
dulness and prostration; excessive swellings not only cutaneous
but in the nose and throat as well; a marked oozing from the
swellings with a tendency to form cracks, fissures and sloughs;
the serious obstruction of breathing and prevention of hæmatosis
by blocking of the nose, pharynx or larynx by sanguineous and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>serous exudate; the appearance of oppressed breathing and other
indications of exudate with the lungs and chest, or of colics,
diarrhœa, and other suggestions of effusion on the bowels or in
the abdomen. Extreme fetor of the expired air and of the fæces
is a bad symptom, though not always a fatal one. Sudden retrocession
of the cutaneous swellings, may be the precursor of
internal exudations and death, yet in the absence of marked acceleration
of the pulse, and of the objective symptoms of disease of
the chest or abdomen, it is rather to be taken as a herald of recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> Whatever may be the precise cause of petechial
fever it is largely connected with and maintained by an unhealthy
condition of the blood, and especially with the presence of toxins
and waste products in that liquid. The first consideration is to
secure for the patient the best possible sanitary conditions. A
roomy loose box, dry, clean, well lighted and well aired, nourishing,
easily digested food—green food, carrots, turnips, or
mashes—and pure water are desiderata. A sunny exposure is
desirable especially in winter, and everything like chill should be
guarded against. Blanketing may be called for in cold weather,
but the circingle like the halter should be avoided as being
calculated to cause indentation, cracking or sloughing of the
swellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moderate action of the bowels should be secured by the
nature of the food (linseed meal or tea), or by small doses of
saline laxatives (sodium sulphate) or calomel. Suppression of
the urine too, must be counteracted by diuretics (saltpeter, oil of
turpentine) when necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Further internal medication has been aimed to correct the
dilatation of the capillaries, and to prove antidotal to or to
eliminate the poisons present in the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>As <i>vaso-motor</i> stimulants have been employed ergot, belladonna,
tannic, sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, oil of turpentine, iron
sulphate, potassium bichromate and chlorate, quinia sulphate,
and strychnia sulphate and arsenate. The value of any one of
these is dependent on its early employment, the slight character
of the lesions and the remissions that so often occur even in
severe attacks. None are of much account in a violent attack at
its worst.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>In the slighter cases <i>ergotin</i>, 5 grains daily in two doses, has
been apparently useful. An objection is that its continued action
on the nerve centres and digestive organs is liable to prove
depressing and injurious. Of the acids, <i>tannic</i> is liable to
engender constipation, locking up the injurious products to which,
however, it acts to some extent as an antiseptic. <i>Sulphuric</i> and
<i>hydrochloric</i> acids have a tonic effect, and the latter is a stomachic
under ordinary conditions. The same may be said of the <i>iron
salts</i> and to some extent of <i>oil of turpentine</i>, which have both
proved useful in favorable cases. Cadeac condemns ol. terebinth
as calculated to abolish kidney secretions. The <i>potash salts</i>,
<i>bichromate</i> and <i>chlorate</i>, and <i>quinia sulphate</i> are decided antiseptics
and though the admissible dose would not ensure the destruction
of bacteria, yet, acting in the system, with leucocytes and leucomaines,
they may serve by keeping them in check. The <i>chlorate
of potash</i> is given to the extent of an ounce the first day, and of
half an ounce on succeeding days. The <i>quinine</i> salt is given in
half ounce doses once or twice daily. In combination with bitters
they seem to be of material value. <i>Nux vomica</i> (1 dram) or
<i>strychnia sulphate</i> or <i>arsenate</i> (2 grains) given twice daily has
seemed to be among the most promising agents of this class. As
a potent vaso-motor stimulant, a bitter tonic and stomachic,
strychnia has seemed at times to rouse the vitality and enable the
system to throw off the load of poison that depresses it. The
wonderful power of <i>adrenalin chloride</i> as a vaso-motor stimulant
more than warrants its use both locally and generally. In using
any one of these agents, we should not neglect concurrent attention
to the bowels and kidneys, to antisepsis internally and
externally, to hygienic and tonic measures generally.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Antiseptic agents</i> have been given by the alimentary canal, the
skin, the subcutis, and the air passages.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the <i>stomach</i> the following have proved more or less useful
in checking gastro-intestinal fermentations, and perhaps in hindering
absorption of toxins from the specific lesions on this track:
<i>phenic acid</i>, <i>creolin</i>, <i>lysol</i>, <i>ichthyol</i>, <i>boric acid</i>, <i>salicylic acid</i>, <i>sodium
salicylate</i> and <i>hyposulphite</i>, and <i>calomel</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the <i>superficial swellings</i>, <i>fissures</i> and <i>sores</i> the same agents
may be freely applied, alone, or combined with astringents, such
as <i>alum</i>, <i>lead acetate</i>, <i>aluminum acetate</i>. In the hot season they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>may be applied cold, whereas in the cold weather hot applications
are often preferable. Aruch claims excellent results from
covering the engorged head with a woolen cloth and irrigating it
with cold water.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question of drainage of the worst cutaneous swellings by
<i>scarification</i>, has been variously dealt with, Dieckerhoff advocating
deep incisions, while Friedberger and others forbid them as encreasing
the tendency to necrotic infection and sloughing. In
the slighter cases it can well be omitted, but in extensive swellings
the disintegrating and debilitating action on the tissues is so
great as to well warrant its prevention by incisions and drainage. It
is well to first give the surface a soapy wash, then apply a mercuric
chloride or carbolic acid lotion and lance it in the prominent
and tense portions. As a further precaution against septic infection
it may then be covered by cotton soaked in one of the
above lotions and covered with a bandage. For swellings beneath
the abdomen or chest this may be held in place by loose
circingles. Scarifying becomes imperative in case of paraphymosis
arresting the flow of urine. Deep fissures and sores following
sloughing may be treated with mercuric chloride solution,
(1:1000), creolin or phenic acid (2:100), iodoform, dermatin,
naphthalin or salol.</p>

<p class='c008'>Disinfection of the <i>nasal passages</i> has been attempted by pervading
the air with carbolic acid, creolin, cresyl, lysol, or naphthalin,
by hanging saturated cloths in the stall, or spreading them
on the floor. Perhaps a better method is to flush out the nose,
by injecting each chamber in turn with a piece of rubber tubing,
one end of which is introduced into the nose, and the other
raised four feet and furnished with a funnel. The injection may
be 1 dram creolin to 2 quarts water, or carbolic acid or alum may
be substituted or alternated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The swelling of the nostrils may be so great that it becomes
requisite to hold them open mechanically. The suture of the
two altogether, across above the nose has been practiced, or a
tube of light wood or aluminum can be inserted in each nostril.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Injection of the trachea and bronchia</i> with a solution of iodine 1
part, potassium iodide 5 parts, and water 100 or 200 parts, was
advocated by Dieckerhoff and met with a fair measure of success
in mild cases. In some cases, however, granular tracheitis and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>bronchitis followed, and in others necrotic tracheitis and pulmonary
gangrene, so that the method has not been widely accepted.
If resorted to, the weaker solution is to be preferred, and may be
injected through a tracheal ring, or the membrane between two
rings twice a day in doses of 3 to 5 centigrammes (45 to 75 drops).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Injection into the veins of Argentum Colloidale</i>, 1 per cent solution
in doses of 1⅔ oz. (50 grammes) at intervals of 2 hours has
been very strongly advocated by Dieckerhoff who in four successive
cases had complete recoveries in from three to six days.
After disinfection of the skin a small trochar and cannula, or a
hypodermic needle is introduced into the jugular and the injection
made. Local treatment for the swellings was also applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Injection subcutem of the <i>antistreptococcic serum</i> of Marmorec,
has been lauded as promptly overcoming the capillary dilatation,
and enabling the leucocytes to neutralize the toxins.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally Menveux recommends an artificial compound as possessing
all the good qualities of the antistreptococcic serum.
This is composed of sodium chloride 5 grammes, sodium phosphate
1 gramme, sodium sulphate 20 centigrammes, sodium carbonate
1 gramme, caffein chlorhydrate 10 grammes, boiled filtered
water 100 grammes. Inject daily in three doses 135 grammes.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PETECHIAL FEVER IN CATTLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Synonyms. Causes: microbes, maturity, hard work, chill, poor hygiene,
drying of damp lands in summer and autumn, impermeable soils, corrupt
water, bacillus, diplococcus; resemblance to hæmorrhagic septicæmia.
Lesions: petechiæ and hæmorrhages on mucosæ, serosæ and skin; gelatinoid
exudates gravitating to the lowest parts of face, chest, belly and legs;
chaps, oozing, sloughs, depilation, exudate in tongue, bloody diarrhœa, duration
14 to 40 days, mortality light; indurations. Diagnosis: from anthrax,
black quarter, malignant œdema and acute hæmorrhagic septicæmia.
Prevention: avoid infecting soils in summer and autumn; drainage, cultivation;
chills. Treatment: venesection: laxatives, diuretics: intratracheal
injections of iodine: colloidal silver. Locally: antiseptic astringents: remove
eschars: facilitate breathing by surgical or mechanical means: good
hygiene.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Purpura Hæmorrhagica. Anasarca. Inflammatory
Œdema. Yellow Water. Morbus Maculosus.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>This malady presents phenomena very similar to those found
in the horse, and shows itself in mild and severe types. It has
been noted by writers on diseases of cattle from Vegetius down,
though under quite a variety of names.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> These are uncertain, though much seems to point to
microbian invasion or intoxication by microbian poisons. In
France, it has been seen mainly in mature and robust working
oxen after a hard day’s work, when the animal has had time to cool
off. Also in cows used in the yoke and milked at the same time.
Poor food, starvation and low condition have also been cited as
causes. In other cases, high feeding and plethora have been incriminated.
It shows itself most commonly in summer and
autumn, so that cold or chill must be looked on as a cause secondary
to another—probably microbian or toxic. Again, it is
by far the most common in the adult animal. What is more suggestive
is its relative frequency in localities characterized by
swamps, springy fields, hollow basins, damp hill-foots, bottom
lands, and damp, impermeable or undrained soils. Again, on
heavy clays where the water is preserved through summer in open
ponds and often in a very corrupt condition. This at once accounts
for its common appearance in summer and autumn when
the offensive products of fermentation are most abundant, and
corroborates the doctrine of a toxic ferment. But its origin has
not been definitely traced to such products as yet. This, notwithstanding
that Kolb attributes it to <i>bacillus hæmorrhagicus</i>,
and Robert, Fabert, and Dinter found the exudates swarming
with <i>diplococci</i>. This may assimilate it to <i>septicæmia</i> hæmorrhagica.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> In cattle killed during the early stages, circumscribed
hæmorrhages and petechiæ are found in the nose, trachea,
bronchia, gastric and intestinal mucosæ, cerebral membranes,
pleuræ, peritoneum, bladder, and skin. In many cases these are
accompanied by congestion and thickening of the walls of the
lymphatics, and effusion in and under the skin in different parts
of the body, but especially along its lower aspect—(belly, sternum,
dewlap, limbs, lower jaw, tongue)—of a gelatinoid exudate,
which raises the skin abruptly in the form of a thick cushion. At
first this is soft and tremulous, but later it may have coagulated
giving a great degree of resistance to the structure. Extensive
cracks, fissures, and sloughs, and unhealthy sores form on these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>swellings. Franck especially notes the enlarged tongue gorged
with blood and yellowish exudate as in gloss-anthrax. The
blood extravasation may be further evidenced in the black or
blood-streaked fæces, the reddish urine, and a rosy tint of the
milk.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The animal is dull, sluggish, moves stiffly and
with difficulty, and shows hyperthermia, (102° to 106° F.), inappetence,
impaired or suspended rumination, heat of the roots
of the ears and horns, and of the dry muzzle; the spine, and
usually certain points beneath the sternum or abdomen at which
swellings are about to appear, are tender to the touch. On the
affected parts of the skin the temperature is raised, and there
may be detected pea-like elevations which become surrounded
and enveloped in extensive swellings that pit on pressure. The
swellings show a preference for the thinner and looser parts of
the skin, and gravitate rapidly toward dependent parts. Thus,
the eyelids, roots of the ears, intermaxillary space, throat, muzzle,
dewlap, ventral aspect of the body, axilla, mammæ, scrotum,
groin, thigh, knee and hock are favorite spots, the liquid rapidly
gravitating downward through the loose connective tissue to the
lowest points. The face becomes infiltrated to unsightly dimensions,
interrupting prehension and threatening suffocation, the
dewlap swells up to a great size, the forearms or thighs become
rounded and tense, and a thick pad forms along the ventral aspect
of the body. The white skin on such swellings becomes red,
they may ooze a yellowish liquid or blood, the surface becomes
depilated, scaly and rough, chaps and cracks appear, going on,
it may be, to deep fissures, more particularly at the flexures of
the joints, on the throat or muzzle, or on other points that are
subjected to pressure. Necrosis of great patches of skin is not
uncommon, and these sloughing off leave large wounds with unhealthy,
indolent surface and little disposed to rapid healing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The petechiæ show early on the muzzle, the nasal and buccal
mucosæ, and on other mucous membranes. Exudations also
appear and a serous, often bloody, discharge escapes from the
nose and concretes in colored encrustations around the nostrils.
The nose may be obstructed causing the animal to breathe
through the open mouth, protruding the tongue which is often
also the seat of extensive swelling, discoloration and induration.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>As the disease advances there is encreased dullness and prostration,
marked emaciation, and anæmia, sunken eyes, encrusted
eyelids, extensive areas of depilation including even the long
hairs of the tail, and quite often an abundant bloody diarrhœa.</p>

<p class='c008'>The affection may last for 24 to 40 days and under rational
treatment the majority survive. There remains, however, in a
certain number of cases, a permanent enlargement and fibrous
induration from the organization of the exudate.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> A fully developed case is easily recognized. The
fever and constitutional disorder, complicated by petechiæ on the
mucosæ and skin; the extensive swellings suddenly formed,
oozing serum or blood, and tending to fissures and necrosis; and
the discharge of blood from the nose, bowels, kidneys and udder,
in the absence of the bacilli of anthrax, emphysematous anthrax,
malignant œdema, and wildeseuche; the slower progress; the
low mortality; the occurrence on a damp, springy, or impermeable
soil, or one known to produce this disease; and especially if
in late summer or autumn, become virtually pathognomonic.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> Seclude cattle in late summer and autumn
especially, from soils known to be productive of this affection and
above all from damp wet clays, underlaid by hardpan, from
swamps, from drying up ponds and basins, from wet river
bottoms and deltas and from springy fields generally. Fields of
this kind may be reserved for cultivated crops or for raising hay.
The fundamental remedy is thorough drainage, and a subsequent
abandonment of the land for a year or two to other crops to allow
of a dissipation of the poison. Sudden chills after being heated
or fatigued, and exposure in the pasture in cold nights are to be
avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> The French writers up to the present extol
bleeding for the early stages. Its benefit must apparently depend
on the diminution of the blood tension allowing the distended
capillaries to resume their normal contractility, and in the
lessening of the tendency to exosmosis, and the encrease of
endosmosis so that much of the poison in the blood is removed
and what remains is largely diluted and rendered comparatively
harmless. However well this may operate in the strong and
plethoric, it cannot be considered as applicable to the weak or
anæmic, nor to advanced cases in which the vital powers are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>already seriously reduced by the abundant exudations and
extravasations, and by the narcotic and devitalizing action of the
circulating toxins.</p>

<p class='c008'>With us the demand is usually met by laxatives and diuretics,
under the idea that these are less debilitating and that if the
morbid process can be arrested recovery is more prompt and
perfect. A purge of sulphate of soda is followed by full doses
of nitrate or acetate of potash, in combination with iodide of
potassium, or chlorate of potash; or bicarbonate of soda associated
with hyposulphite of soda. These or other diuretics should
be pushed so as to produce free diuresis. Stimulating antiseptic
diuretics like ol. terebinth, may be added. Iodine solutions injected
into the trachea have been recommended as for the horse
(Huber, Heuberger, Rohr,) and the serum or silver preparations
or adrenalin may be tried.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Locally</i> astringents and antiseptics have given good results.
Solutions of alum or lead acetate with carbolic acid and iodine;
frictions with soap liniment, with a mixture of aqua ammonia,
oil of turpentine and oil, or with mixtures of oils of origanum,
cajeput and peppermint, and iodine, or simple painting with tinct. of
iodine may be cited. Fissures and open sores may be dressed
with mercuric chloride solutions (1:1000), Lugol’s solution,
phenic acid lotion, solution of creolin, lysol, or chloronaphtholeum,
camphorated spirit, or other antiseptic agent. The nose should
be injected, cleared of eschars, and if necessary propped open.</p>

<p class='c008'>An abundant, wholesome, easily digested diet, pure air, a dry
stall and protection against cold are essential.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> A febrile hemorrhagic septicæmia of chickens and
other fowls (pigeons, ducks, geese, parrots, etc.) communicable
to certain rodents and other animals, and characterized by a short
incubation, rapid progress, great prostration, violent diarrhœa
usually greenish, and a high mortality (90 to 95 per cent.).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History, Geographical distribution.</i> It is quoted as prevalent
in Lombardy in 1789, in East India in 1817, in France in 1825,
and generally in Europe and America in the last half century.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>The <i>losses</i> from the ravages of this disease are far greater than
the average value of the individual animal would lead one to suppose,
but with domestic fowls numbering 300,000,000 and a yearly
egg crop bordering on a billion dozens it may well be called
enormous.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> Chicken cholera is caused by a very small ovoid
bacterium (B. Choleræ gallinaceæ) about 0.3 to 1.8μ long, as
found in the blood and tissues of the fowl. It has the general
characters of the groups which cause hemorrhagic septicæmia,
thus: 1. It fixes, above all at the poles, the ordinary anilin colors;
2. It is decolorized by the methods of Gram and Wiegert
(iodine solutions); 3. It grows on gelatine without liquefying it;
4. It produces acute septicemic lesions; 5. It tends to polymorphism
when grown under different conditions. In the peritoneum
of the guinea pig it forms cocco-bacilli tending in acute and violent
cases to diplococci. Fed to rabbits it appears in the fæces as
a minute bacillus. Even the mode of staining causes a difference
in appearance. Fixed in alcohol-ether, and then stained in Ziehl’s
phenated preparation, coloring is polar, and the central area clear.
If in place of Ziehl’s fluid, hot fuchsin solution is used warm for
½ a minute, bacillus or cocco-bacillus is shown (Lignieres). It
is nonmotile, though some observers have been misled by Brownian
movements. There are no flagella. In old bouillon cultures
short chain forms are met with. No spores are formed.</p>

<p class='c008'>From fresh cultures, in flask or in animals, the bacterium
grows readily in alkaline culture media. In <i>bouillon</i> a turbidity
ensues, and after some days pellicles form on the surface and
walls, and the liquid slowly clears. The addition of a little blood
serum, sugar or glycerine encreases and hastens the growth,
while acid retards or prevents. This is common also to other
septicemic germs. In <i>gelatine</i> growth is tardy, but in two or
three days there are whitish glistening colonies, becoming
opaque later, and appearing granular if slightly magnified. In
punctures minute colonies form along the line of culture and one
at the surface, at first translucent; later opaque. On <i>agar</i> the
colonies grow faster with similar appearance. On <i>gelose</i> at 37° C.
the colonies are blueish and iridescent, at first, and later opaque.
If the germ has been repeatedly passed through the Guinea pig,
they are more translucent. On <i>potato</i> with alkaline surface,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>there is a delicate grayish yellow growth after 48 hours; if acid,
growth ceases. In <i>milk</i> there is no coagulation nor acidification
for four weeks; then it becomes slowly clear and opalescent.
With <i>sugars</i> it is not gas producing. With dextrose it forms an
acid solution; with saccharose or lactose an alkaline one. Cultures
in peptone gave a strong <i>indol</i> reaction (V. A. Moore).
Lignieres found no indol in cultures in pancreatic bouillon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacterium perishes when heated to 58° C. for fifteen
minutes. It dies in carbolic acid solution (1:100) in five minutes;
in sulphuric acid solution (0.25:100) in ten minutes; in lime water
in ten minutes; and in sulphur fumes in three hours. Easily destroyed
by disinfectants, it remains potent for months in flasks or
buildings that are not subjected to disinfection. It is not killed by
drying (T. Smith and V. A. Moore) nor by zero temperature
maintained for seventeen hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cultures, especially those made in agar have a very characteristic
odor.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> Birds sent to poultry shows will often contract
the disease and introduce it into the home flock on their
return. It may also be imported in newly purchased birds, or on
eggs obtained for hatching. It is even alleged that it has been
propagated by feeding healthy hens on the eggs of diseased ones.
When chickens run at large it passes easily from flock to flock in
the immediate vicinity. The infected manure is, however, the
most common channel of infection. Carried on the feet or bill
this contaminates the food and drinking water, and washed into
streams and ponds, it finally in any case reaches the alimentary
canal of the susceptible bird. Or drying up and raised as dust it
is inhaled into the lungs. Or finally from any such source it infects
any open sore. As granivorous birds, wild and tame, suffer
from fowl cholera, it is often introduced by the wild, especially
coming from infected poultry yards. Predatory birds, like hawks
and buzzards, but the latter especially, are common bearers of infection.
Rabbits, which contract the affection so readily, transmit
it equally with birds, but man or beast, soiled by the manure will
convey it. Insects are among the most prolific bearers, hence, as
noted by Salmon, the infection may fail to overstep a close fence
in winter, but is subject to no such limitation during the fly
season. In this respect chicken cholera agrees with Asiatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>cholera, typhoid fever and other affections in which the virus
abounds in the alvine discharges. The sale and transportation of
the guano from the infected poultry yard is a direct cause of new
outbreaks. Feeding on the carcasses or offal of the infected birds
is a further cause. It must not be forgotten that the microbe is
largely saprophytic, living indefinitely in the organic matter in
soils, and determining new outbreaks when brought in contact
with susceptible animals. Thus a period of immunity may be
followed by infection when new birds are brought in or when
young and susceptible ones grow up.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Susceptible Animals.</i> Fowl cholera is preëminently a disease
of chickens, but the microbe is successfully transferred to pigeons,
peafowl, pheasants, parrots, ducks, canaries, sparrows and other
small birds, also to Guinea pigs, rabbits, white and gray mice.
Guinea pigs have abscesses in the seats of inoculation (Pasteur);
the same is alleged of sheep and horses (Kitt), and man (Marchiafava,
Celli). Injection into a cow’s teat caused chronic
catarrhal mammitis in which the microbe persisted for a long
while (Kitt). Like other members of the group of microbes
causing septicæmia hæmorrhagica, the pathogeny and even the
morphology are liable to material modification as grown in
different environment (genera). Some of the forms of cholera
occurring among domesticated birds and held to be distinct diseases
may find in this an explanation. Rabieaux claims that
under favorable conditions it has been transmitted to the frog.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> This varies from 18 to 48 hours, the usual being
24 hours.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> In some <i>fulminant cases</i> the animal is found dead
a few hours after apparently blooming health; it may even have
died on the nest or fallen dead from the roost. Cadeac speaks of
transient symptoms even in such cases—extreme dulness, prostration,
somnolence, seclusion in a cool, dark place, ruffling of
feathers, sinking of the head between the wings, drooping, trailing
wings and tail, violet comb, gaping, discharge of glairy
mucus from the bill, convulsions and death. These symptoms
last from two to five hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>acute</i> but less fulminant forms there is loss of appetite, depression,
debility, apathy, erection of the feathers, sinking of
the head, swaying when made to walk, drooping wings and tail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>sitting on the breast, convulsive tremblings, discharge of filmy or
frothy mucus by the nose or mouth, vomiting, hyperthermia
(108° to 111° F. ), sighing, breathing, inflation of the crop, violet
colored comb, wattles and mucosæ, great thirst and diarrhœa, at
first pultaceous and light yellow, later glairy, green and fetid.
The feathers round the anus become soaked and matted with the discharge.
Temperature becomes subnormal, the patient falls and
is unable to rise, and finally dies in a stupor or convulsions, the
illness having lasted 1 to 3 days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Milder cases</i> occurring chiefly towards the end of an outbreak
when the less susceptible animals only are left, or when the microbe
has become less virulent, show a larger ratio of recoveries.
These show a lack of spirit and vigor, impaired appetite,
diarrhœa, emaciation, dulness, prostration, moping, ruffling of
the plumes, dark discoloration of the comb, and often swelling
of one or more important joints (femoro-tibial, etc.). These may
burst and discharge a reddish pus, or simply form dark or grayish
swellings. These cases may drag along for a week or more and
finally die in marasmus. The minute bacillus is not obtainable
from these (Lignieres).</p>

<p class='c008'>Cases inoculated in the pectoral muscles with only one or two
microbes usually have only a circumscribed slough, with loss of
condition, and after the elimination of the slough and the healing
of the sore the bird proves immune.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The alimentary canal is the main seat of morbid
changes. The intestinal walls, and especially the mucosa, have
points and patches of blood extravasation, extensive areas of
congestion with ramified redness, exudation and thickening.
The intestinal contents are watery, frothy, browned or blackened
by effused blood, and swarming with ferments including the
specific bacterium. The mucous surface is brownish or blackish,
and epithelial degeneration and desquamation with abrasions are
not uncommon especially on the summits of the duodenal folds
and villi. Croupous exudates and swelling or ulceration of the
follicles are met with. The lymph glands at the base of the
cæcum are often enlarged and congested. The crop is full of
watery, pulpy, frothy or slimy contents, and its mucosa and that
of the pharynx may be deeply congested.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsewhere the lesions suggest rather the action of destructive
toxins and the profound changes in the blood. Pericardium and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>endocardium are usually studded with dark petechiæ, and congestion
and even slight exudation may be present. The spleen
is enlarged, soft, and gorged with blood. The liver is swollen,
congested, extremely friable, and mottled, grayish white from
degenerations. The kidneys are dark red, and friable. The
lungs may show slight hyperæmia only, or a blood engorgement
and consolidation, and are then easily reduced to a dark red
pulp. Friedberger and Fröhner say that respiratory changes are
most frequent in land birds; and intestinal and cardiac in water
fowl.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blood is diffluent coagulating loosely if at all, of a brownish
red color, reddening slowly and imperfectly in contact with air,
and like the tissues contains an abundance of the characteristic
bacterium staining deeply at the poles and clear in the center.</p>

<p class='c008'>In birds that survive a few days there are marked anæmia and
emaciation, and the muscular system is of a grayish red color, with
fatty degeneration. In acute and fulminant cases on the other
hand the muscles may be full and of the normal red color.</p>

<p class='c008'>In arthritic cases the congestion and thickening of the soft
tissues, and the excess of synovia, are supplemented by destruction
of the articular cartilage and by areas of bone abrasion. In
the more tardy cases collections of caseous matter are found.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> This is based on the demonstrably highly contagious
character of the disease, its rapid spread in a flock, and
from the first to nearby adjoining flocks in summer, the short
period of incubation, the constancy and nature of the diarrhœa,
the speedy and great mortality, and the hemorrhagic lesions of
comb, bowels, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and serous
membranes. The demonstration of the bacterium in the blood
and affected tissues is conclusive. Kitt points out that inoculation
of a pigeon kills the bird in 12 to 48 hours, with dry yellow
exudate in patches of from ½ to ¾ inch in diameter on the surface
of the muscles, and yellow discoloration and nodular induration
beneath.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis.</i> The mortality reaches 90 to 95 per cent. The
negative chemiotaxis exerted on the leucocytes by the microbe,
precludes defensive phagocytosis, and the progress of the deadly
microbe is comparatively unhindered. Toward the end of a
severe outbreak, and in certain mild epizoötics the recoveries are
much greater.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span><i>Prevention.</i> All birds bought or otherwise acquired and all
birds returning from shows should be quarantined for one week
before being allowed to mingle with the flock. In summer this
should be conducted inside fly screens. The manure should be
burned, carefully secluded, or treated with dilute sulphuric acid.
Buzzards and vermin as possible bearers of the infection should be
excluded from poultry yards. So with human beings, dogs, etc.,
coming from infected places. In an infected flock the sick should be
at once separated, killed and burned or treated with sulphuric acid.
All manure should be treated in the same way. Buildings, yards
and runs should be thoroughly cleaned and liberally sprinkled
with a dilute sulphuric acid (2:100). If the birds can be divided
up in small groups (say of 5) the appearance of the disease will
only endanger that group. In small flocks or with very valuable
birds it may even be well to take the body temperature morning
and night and separate at once any bird showing a rise. Any
diseased or suspected flock should be kept where its manure will
not be washed into wells, running streams or ponds to which
other birds have access. In a locality where the disease exists
fowls should not be allowed to run at large. In winter this is
very effective; in summer owing to the danger from insect bearers,
it must be supplemented by the most scrupulous cleanliness
of poultry houses and yards, and by a liberal sprinkling with
dilute sulphuric acid, or other disinfectant, to be made especially
abundant and frequent on the manure. Nocard cuts short the
disease by injections, subcutem of a 5 per cent. solution of carbolic
acid.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization.</i> With valuable birds it may be desirable to
secure immunization by non-fatal inoculations. Salmon secured
this by first estimating the number of microbes in an mm. of the
blood, then diluting until five drops would contain but one, or at
most two of these organisms, and injecting this amount into the
pectoral muscles. A sequestrum forms in the muscle and is
gradually sloughed out, and the cavity heals, with resulting immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pasteur produced a weakened virus by exposing the artificial
bouillon cultures to air for from three to ten months, the strength
decreasing with the length of exposure. The weaker form produces
slight illness only, from which recovery is prompt. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>second and stronger virus is used ten or twelve days later and
produces a real immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drawbacks to these methods are: 1st; that fowls are of
too little value, to warrant inoculation in healthy flocks; 2d;
that in infected flocks, where it is employed, the more susceptible
birds are usually already contaminated, and a large proportion
die in spite of it; and 3d; that it becomes a means of planting
the infection in new localities (Kitt).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> The disease is so deadly that little can be hoped
from medicinal treatment. It has been directed mainly to gastric
and intestinal disinfection. Copperas and sulphuric or hydrochloric
acid in the drinking water ½ to 1 per cent. of each is at
once prophylactic and curative. Friedberger and Fröhner add
fennel or peppermint, and give a tablespoonful every hour to an
affected chicken. Other agents recommended are: carbolic acid
(5:100) by the mouth or subcutem (Nocard), salicylate of soda,
quinia (Cadeac), tannic acid (2:100), salol, naphthol, tar water,
etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> A contagious, febrile affection attacking dogs
(and by inoculation cats), and tending to local inflammatory and
degenerative lesions in the mucosæ, lungs, bowels, liver, skin,
kidneys, and nervous system,—a first attack usually immunizing
against a second.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Synonyms.</i> Contagious catarrhal fever; Dog ill; Bronchial
Catarrh; Intestinal Catarrh; <i>Fr.</i> Maladie des Chiens, Maladie
du jeune age, Typhoïde, Typhus des chenils, Variole du chien;
<i>Ger.</i> Staupe; <i>It.</i> Cimurro.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> Dogs, especially puppies and young dogs,
and other members of the canine race, fox, jackal, hyena, wolf.
Cats suffer from inoculation (Laosson), also apes (Cadeac). Old
cats and dogs are often immune, also all animals that have passed
through one attack of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History.</i> The older English veterinarians quote the epizoötics
in dogs described by Virgil, Aristotle and even Homer as probably
distemper. Laosson attributes to it a canine epizoötic which
prevailed in Bohemia in 1028. It appears to have been unknown
in Europe in the earlier third of the 18th century though prevailing
in Peru. According to Ulloa, it was introduced from Peru
into Spain in 1735, whence, it spread into France (1740), Germany
(1748), Ionian Isles, Greece (1759), England (1760),
Italy (1764) and Russia (1770), Sweden and Norway (1815),
Siberia (1821). Since that time it has prevailed in Europe and
many dependencies of European nations.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span><i>Causes.</i> Its advent in Europe as a new disease in the second
third of the 18th century, its steady spread, its continued prevalence,
and extension, concur with the infection of kennels and
districts by the introduction of a sick dog, in demonstrating its
purely contagious nature, and this implies a living microbe transferred
from animal to animal. If any doubt remained it must be
dispelled by the inoculations which have been constantly successful
when made on young puppies, or dogs that have not previously
suffered, and on cats. A first attack confers immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among <i>accessory causes</i> may be especially named <i>contact with
the sick dog</i>, its <i>clothing</i> or <i>bedding</i>, and above all its <i>kennel</i>. A
kennel may retain infection indefinitely, especially if there is a
constant accession of puppies or susceptible dogs. On the contrary
it is not readily carried on the clothes of attendants, and
the inmates of a kennel often remain sound, though only separated
by a yard from the infected one, and though cared for by
the same attendant. Yet so universally diffused is the contagion
that few dogs escape it until they are a year old.</p>

<p class='c008'>The habit of letting dogs run at large, to meet in roads and
fields is a most prolific cause, which might easily be done away
with where distemper is prevalent.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>chill</i> is a common condition, hence injudicious washing,
swimming in cold water, exposure of house dogs to cold storms,
or outdoors at night, sleeping in cold, damp cellars, on cold stones
or metal plates, or in passages in a current of cold air are frequent
factors. Yet it often spreads rapidly in the summer, the
heat favoring the preservation and diffusion of the germ.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>House dogs</i> as a rule suffer more severely, as their systems are
more sensitive to the cold, and the resisting power to invading
microbes is lessened. Country dogs and those living in the open
air are hardier and more resistant and often have the disease in a
mild form.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>High bred dogs</i> suffer more severely probably largely from the
greater protection and care lavished on them and their consequent
diminished power of resistance. Newfoundlands, great
Danes, pointers, pugs, poodles, spaniels and greyhounds may be
named as especially liable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exposure to infection at <i>shows</i>, and in traveling by <i>rail</i>,
<i>steamboat</i> or <i>other infected conveyance</i> must be considered as among
the prominent causes.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>An exclusively <i>bread diet</i> has been recognized as a predisposing
cause, by reason of its lowering the stamina of the carnivorous
animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any condition which induces <i>debility</i> whether severe or continued
disease, parasitisms, impure air, under feeding, improper
food, rachitis, or scurvy, etc., must be admitted to operate in the
same way. Any <i>catarrhal disease</i> of the nose or bronchia is
especially conducive to the affection by weakening the mucosa
and making an easy entrance channel for the germs.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Change of climate</i> is a strongly predisposing condition, which
not only hastens an attack, but even, at times, arouses anew the
susceptibility in dogs that have passed through a first attack.
Dogs that suffered in England have had a second attack in India,
and some have even had a third attack when brought back to
Europe. Four attacks within a year, in the same dog, and without
change of climate, are recorded by Friedberger and Fröhner.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Youth</i> is much more susceptible than age, even apart from the
immunity which comes to the mature dog from a first attack.
Yet some puppies are insusceptible from birth.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> No one pathogenic organism has been proved
to be the constant infecting agent, yet two classes of investigators
have contended in favor of micrococci and bacilli respectively.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Micrococci</i>, 1 to 3μ in diameter, singly or in chains of 6 or 8
have been found in the blood, lungs, liver, kidneys and spleen
(Semmer, Friedberger, Krajewski, Rabe, Mathis, Marcone,
Meloni, Kitt).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacilli</i> were found associated with micrococci by Semmer, Legrain
and Jacquot, Laosson, Millais, Schantyr, and Galli-Valerio.
As observed by the latter they were 1.25, to 2.5μ long, by 0.31μ
broad and took the Gram stain. Cultivated on gelatine the
colonies were waxy, lustrous points, which indented the gelatine
without liquefying it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cultures of the mixed bacteria (cocci and bacilli) and their
inoculation on young dogs produced the symptoms of distemper
with subsequent immunity (Laosson, Millais). Legrain and
Jacquot claimed immunity, as resulting from inoculations with
the cocci in pure cultures. Galli-Valerio, using the mixed cultures
produced all the symptoms (pulmonary and cerebro-spinal)
of distemper.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Schantyr, ignoring the cocci, describes three bacilli which
cause three different diseases (distemper, abdominal typhus, and
typhoid), but the distinctions are not clear nor generally accepted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres and Even, in Argentina, and dealing with the more
susceptible high bred dogs (fox terriers, great Danes and carlins),
found constantly in the blood of the dog, in the early stages of
the disease, a long, delicate bacillus, nonmotile and easily
stained in aniline, but not by Gram’s method. Inoculated on
the Guinea pig it shortens, approximating rapidly in successive
passages to a cocco-bacillus, and assumes the general characters
of Lignieres’s <i>pasteurella</i>. Different bacteria may be found in the
lungs, bronchial and nasal mucus, tears and vesicles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres’s <i>pasteurella</i> is inoculable on the Guinea pig, mouse,
rabbit, and dog, producing the symptoms of local or general infection.
Two centigrammes, subcutem, in the <i>Guinea pig</i>, produced
a local œdema, disappearing in four or five days and securing
immunity. Five cc. subcutem proved fatal in 48 hours;
intraperitoneal in 24 hours. In the <i>rabbit</i> 1cc., subcutem,
caused local œdema for 2 days and hyperthermia (104°) for 3
days; 1cc. intravenously, caused fever for 3 weeks, diffluent
blood and hæmorrhagic lesions in lungs, liver, kidneys, bowels,
spleen, and serosæ. In the mouse, 4 to 8 drops, subcutem,
caused œdema, and recovery or death in 2 to 4 days. In such
cases the microbe was found in pure cultures in the blood or inoculated
tissues.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inoculations of the pure cultures on dogs produced in different
cases, gastro-enteritis, pneumonia, pleuro-pericarditis, and arthritis,
in various combinations. If the animal survives it is
immune.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grown on <i>peptonized bouillon</i>, <i>neutral</i> or <i>slightly alkaline</i>, the
bacillus forms, in 24 hours, small granular colonies which fall to
the bottom, leaving the liquid clear. The addition of serum
renders this more abundant without causing opacity.</p>

<p class='c008'>On <i>pancreatic</i> bouillon the growth is very free without indol.</p>

<p class='c008'>On <i>gelatine plates</i> there are fine punctiform colonies, transparent,
but becoming white and opaque in 8 or 10 days. Similar
colonies form in stab and streak cultures. The gelatine is not
liquefied. Cultures in <i>milk</i> cause neither coagulation nor acidity.
There is little or no growth in hay tea, on potato, nor in vacuum.
The cultures have the peculiar odor of the pasteurella.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span><i>Virulent Products.</i> Infection is present sooner or later in all
the morbid animal products. The nasal mucus, bronchial exudate,
saliva, tears, contents of the cutaneous vesicle, milk, contents
of the bowels, and the blood have been successfully inoculated
on susceptible subjects. Inoculations with blood failed
with Bryce, but proved successful with Konnhauser, Krajewski,
Even, Lignieres and Physalix, so that the first named cases
may be explained by a prior immunity, or by a too advanced
stage of the case which furnished the matter. The virulence is
not lost nor even diminished by drying at ordinary temperatures,
freezing (10° F.), nor by moderate dilution in water. Prolonged
exposure at ordinary temperature, however, reduces the virulence,
which is greatly impaired in 15 to 25 days (Laosson), or,
if dried, in three months and upward (Krajewski). Virulence
is easily destroyed by disinfectants,—thorough washing (Menard)
hypochlorous acid (Trasbot), chloride of lime, mercuric chloride,
etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Forms of Distemper.</i> This disease is extremely protean in its
manifestations. Many cases, in country districts especially, are
manifested by a slight fever, with a <i>catarrhal condition of the
mucosæ</i> of the nose, eyes, and throat. In other cases there may
be simply a slight <i>conjunctivitis or keratitis</i>, and in still others a
<i>cutaneous eruption</i>, papular, vesicular or pastular. In some instances
there is slight <i>gastric</i> or <i>hepatic disorder</i> with inappetence
nausea, and vomiting or some irregularity of the bowels. In
such cases recovery may take place in eight or ten days.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the more severe forms, especially seen in house and city
dogs, and in high bred and confined dogs generally, the fever is
high and persistent and the disorders often predominate in particular
organs, hence we see a <i>catarrhal form</i>, a <i>conjunctival</i>, a
<i>bronchitic</i>, a <i>pulmonary</i>, a <i>gastro-intestinal and hepatic</i>, a <i>cutaneous</i>
and a <i>nervous</i>. The severe cases may last for twenty or thirty
days or even in their sequelæ for several months. Exposure to
cold contributes greatly to a pulmonary attack even in inoculated
cases (Lignieres).</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>mortality</i> varies greatly. In country dogs it may be below
20 per cent., whereas in city dogs and those kept confined in close
quarters and in large numbers it may rise to 50, 60 or even 70
per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span><i>Prognosis</i> is especially unfavorable in severe cases; in those
profoundly affecting the brain, lungs or liver; in high bred or
pampered dogs; in the very young; in the debilitated, anæmic
or rhachitic; in those that have been recently imported from
another climate and are as yet unacclimated. Puppies from debilitated
dams, or those raised in a large litter with insufficient
nourishment, or older dogs confined to a purely vegetable diet
show less power of recuperation. Profound prostration and offensive
odor, from excess of toxins are always to be dreaded.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation</i> in inoculated cases varies from four to seven days
(Krajewski). When contracted by simple exposure it may seem
to have been extended to fourteen or even eighteen days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The <i>earliest symptom</i> is hyperthermia (103° to
104° F.) This is accompanied and followed by prostration, dulness,
impaired appetite, erection of the hairs along the spine,
shivering, trembling, seeking a warm place, fatigue on slight
exertion, hot dry nose, burning pads of the feet, sometimes taciturnity.
Later the temperature may descend even to the normal
or there may be alternations of rise and fall. One of the most
characteristic symptoms of distemper is the implication of more
than one set of organs, so that morbid manifestations referable to
the nose, eyes, throat, stomach, skin and nervous system occurring
in the same subject are to be especially noted. In
enumerating the prominent symptoms caused by disease of one
set of organs therefore, it is not to be implied that the absence
of others referring to a different class of organs is to be understood.
On the contrary a complication of several is especially
significant of this disease, though the predominance in one class
of organ will signify a special form of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Respiratory Symptoms.</i> One of the earliest symptoms is usually
sneezing with redness of the nasal mucosa, followed by a muco-purulent
blocking of the nose, and rubbing of it with the paws.
With the implication of the throat there is usually local tenderness
and a hard, painful cough, which may be accompanied by
retching or vomiting. The breathing becomes snuffling, especially
in pugs and bull dogs, and rapid and even oppressed in case of
implication of the smaller bronchia and lungs. The nostrils may
become glued together, the discharge red or dark in color, vesicles
and sores may appear on the mucosa, and the cough gets
paroxysmal, small, weak and husky or gurgling.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Percussion of the lungs may reveal small areas of flatness from
exudate or collapse, and in case of pleurisy and hydrothorax there
is a lack of resonance up to a given horizontal line, varying in
position according to the position of the animal and always keeping
to that part of the thorax which may at the time be lowest.
Auscultation will reveal various sounds according to existing lesions.
There may be a loud blowing murmur over the large bronchia, or
at points to which this sound is conveyed through consolidated lung.
Or a coarse or fine mucous râle may be present indicating the second
stage of bronchitis, or a line of crepitation, around a non-resonant
area indicating pneumonia, or there may be friction sounds or,
later, creaking murmurs from false membranes. Wheezing and
sibilant sounds are not uncommon, also sounds of the heart,
bronchia or bowels, heard in unwonted situations to which they
are conveyed through consolidated lung tissue. Dyspnœa may
become extreme, with puffing out of the cheeks, labial soufle,
and violent inspiratory action. Fœtor of the breath is common.
Emaciation, marasmus, sunken, pale or dark red eyes, putrid
diarrhœa and nervous disorders usually precede death.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Eye Symptoms.</i> Conjunctival congestion is one of the earliest
and most constant symptoms. Weeping, swollen eyelids and red
turgid mucosa. Photophobia may bespeak keratitis. Soon the
watery tears become muco-purulent, matting together the lashes
and even the lids, during the night especially, so that they must
be sponged to get them apart in the morning. The exudate may
accumulate under the lower lid, or may become flocculent, and
usually flows down the cheeks causing matting and even shedding
of the hair. Vesicles exceptionally appear on the conjunctiva;
more frequently it becomes cloudy and opaque, and at points near
the centre, degeneration of the epithelium leads to the formation
of ulcers no larger than pinheads, but extending into the cornea
and sometimes perforating it so as to allow protrusion of the
membrane of Descemet or the escape of the aqueous humor.
The formation and extension of the ulcers are favored by the
general debility, the rubbing of the eye with the paws, and the
infection of abrasions, by pus microbes. This infection may extend
to the lining member of the anterior chamber and even of
the posterior with panophthalmia, but, in the absence of perforation,
internal ophthalmia is rare. When the ulcers heal, white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>cicatricial spots, or black points caused by the adhesion of the
uveal pigment remain.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Digestive and Hepatic Symptoms.</i> Anorexia and vomiting may
usher in the disease. Buccal congestion, dryness, clamminess
and fœtor are marked symptoms and there may be some yellowness
of the mouth and eye. The patient is at first costive, but
diarrhœa often sets in early, with tenesmus, much fœtor, mucus,
froth and even blood, also abdominal pain and tenderness. The
abdomen is habitually tense and contracted. The alvine flux
may rapidly exhaust the animal, or it may continue for a month
in dysenteric form with intense fœtor, weakness, emaciation and
exhaustion. Ulceration of the mouth, gums and rectum, invagination,
prolapsus ani, jaundice, septic pneumonia, paralysis,
chorea, convulsions, or cutaneous eruptions are occasional complications.
The abdominal type of distemper is especially fatal.
Even in its early stages debility, prostration and even drowsiness
are marked features.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cutaneous Symptoms.</i> Skin eruptions are observed in the great
majority of cases, at some stage of the disease, and may remain
as a sequel for a time after apparent recovery. Friedberger and
Fröhner note cases in which the high fever and skin eruption are
the only prominent symptoms, and recovery may be looked for
with some confidence. The lesions are most patent on white
skinned dogs with short hair, and on the more delicate parts of
the skin (abdomen, scrotum, perineum, inside of the thighs and
elbows) but they may extend over the whole body and even extend
on the mucosæ. They vary much in different cases and
stages. There may be punctiform reddish spots, changing to
hard elevated papules, and, in the case of a certain number, to
vesicles and even pustules. Some vesicles may be small and
pointed, but more commonly they are rounded and flat, and as
large as a lentil or small pea. When first formed, the contained
liquid exudate may be clear and transparent, but often it is reddish
or even violet. The individual vesicles tend to speedily
burst, and dry up, but others appear, and thus the eruption will
continue for weeks, the skin meanwhile exuding a sticky, greasy,
offensively smelling exudate which mats the hairs together.
Itching is usually slight, yet in given cases excoriations and sores
are produced with considerable moist discharge. It tends to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>spontaneous recovery when the general health improves and appears
to be little affected by local treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Nervous symptoms.</i> These are shown more or less from the
beginning. The great dulness, depression, apathy and weakness,
which usually usher in the disease, are indications of this. Drowsiness
may be early shown. Even the early nausea and vomiting
may be largely central in its origin. In some cases, however, the
brain symptoms are more active and violent. The dog is restless
and irritable, getting up and moving from place to place, starting
from sleep, yelping, snapping, with twitching of the muscles of the
face or limbs, rolling of the eyes, and excessive heat of the head.
Krajewski even describes rabiform paroxysms, depraved appetite,
spasms, furious delirium, fawning, or threatening, and finally
paraplegia and maxillary paralysis Occurring in a country
where rabies is familiar it would have been more satisfactory if
inoculations had been made from such cases with results negativing
rabies. Epileptic attacks may appear at any stage of the
disease. Chorea, tonic spasms, paresis and paralysis are on the
contrary habitually late manifestations and often seem to be
sequelæ determined by toxin poisoning of the nerve centers, or
degenerations of their structure. Choreic movements may be
confined to the head, or a limb, or they may affect the whole
body. Tonic spasms often affect the neck, turning the head
rigidly to one side. Among other nervous disorders may be
named, amaurosis with dilated pupil and atrophy of the optic nerve,
deafness, anosmia, and dementia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> These vary as do the symptoms. The nasal pharyngeal,
and laryngeal mucosæ show congestion, swelling, infiltration,
ecchymosis with vesicles, pustules and ulcerations. They
are covered by a foul muco-purulent exudate. The same condition
may often be traced to the final ramifications of the bronchial system.
In pulmonary cases, the lungs show inflammation, inflammatory
exudation and consolidation, collapse, splenization, œdema,
and even suppuration in points or large areas. The bronchial
lymph glands and often the pharyngeal are enlarged, congested
and may be suppurating. The pleura over the congested lung
may be the seat of exudation and false membrane, and a bloody
serum may occupy the pleural cavity. The heart may show
parenchymatous degeneration.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>In the digestive organs there may be buccal congestion, with
degeneration and the desquamation of the epithelium and formation
of more or less extended ulceration. The stomach shows similar
congestions and degenerations, the ulcer appearing particularly on
the summit of the folds. Together with the intestines this often
presents numerous petechiæ and ulcerations, and is covered by a
foul but often tenacious mucus. The agminated and solitary
glands are usually swollen and infiltrated, and the mesenteric
glands are swollen, congested and infiltrated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The kidneys are often congested, and show points of blood
extravasation and tissue degeneration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The meninges of the brain and cord are often inflamed with
infiltrations, false membranes, and especially exudation into the
subarachnoid and ventricles. Centres of congestion and softening
have been noted in the brain and cord with embolism of capillaries
and softening and degeneration of their endothelium. Nocard
and others have noted a leucocytic infiltration of the perivascular
lymph spaces. In old standing cases sclerosis is an occasional
feature.</p>

<p class='c008'>In nearly all cases there is marked emaciation and a very
heavy offensive odor comes from the skin, the tissues, the contents
of the bowels and the exudates on the respiratory passages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres alleges that in the early stages, the specific bacillus
is found in the blood and viscera, but that later it is only
exceptionally found and that other bacteria (streptococcus, etc.,)
usually take its place. In the nasal discharge it may be found
at times, but in the more tardily appearing cutaneous vesicles
its absence is the rule, and in the brain matter and meningeal
and ventricular fluids, in cases of paralysis or chorea, it is not to
be detected by culture. Hence the case cannot always be diagnosed
by a successful search for, or culture of the germ, and
hence also the frequently unsuccessful inoculations with the
blood, tears, liquid of vesicles, and even the lung tissues or nasal
discharges.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> Distemper, like any other contagious malady
may be excluded from a city or district by the simple expedient
of shutting out animals that bear the infection. From a kennel
or pack of hounds, new arrivals should be quarantined for a fortnight,
until danger is past, and should only be admitted after a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>good soapy wash. All clothing, collars, brushes and other material
that came with them should be thoroughly disinfected.
Dog shows and other meetings are to be avoided as far as possible,
and any animal that has returned from one should be quarantined
and all his belongings purified. Dogs that run at large should
be carefully excluded from kennels where valuable dogs are kept,
and from all possible contact with them. Even mice, rats, and
birds have to be considered if the disease exists in the near vicinity.
When the disease exists in a district a sound sanitation
would demand the shutting up of all dogs on their owner’s premises,
unless carefully led on chain and prevented from coming
in contact with other dogs.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease has broken out in a pack of hounds, or a
populous kennel, the dogs should be separated into small lots of
3 or 4; the temperatures of all should be taken twice a day; any
lot in which one shows a high temperature should be instantly removed
to a safe distance and placed in quarantine; and the enclosure
where they have been and all their belongings should be
thoroughly disinfected. The enclosures where the sick are kept
must be carefully quarantined so that no infection may escape on
food, water, brushes, utensils, clothing, attendants, cats, vermin,
or even birds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dogs that are still healthy should have spacious, well-aired
dwellings, open air exercise (as much as possible in the
fine season), good but not too stimulating food (in part at least
fresh animal food), pure water, and protection against undue
fatigue, cold, icy baths, especially when exhausted, rain or snow
storms and cold stone or metallic beds. In the cold season artificial
heat in the kennel is desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization</i> may be sought in various ways based on the use
of the toxins and antitoxins on the one hand, and of a weakened
type of virus on the other. Bryce (1882) and others inoculated
with the blood and pulmonary exudate, and produced in three-months-puppies,
local swellings mainly, with subsequent immunity.
The mortality from the inoculation did not exceed 10
to 15 per cent. These losses imply that in certain cases the material
inoculated conveyed the microbe of the disease, and the survivors
acquired all that immunity which comes from a first attack.
In the cases that show local lesions only, it may be presumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>that few microbes or none were inserted, while the results came
mainly from the toxins or antitoxins. This would be entirely in
keeping with Lignieres’ observation that the blood and pulmonary
lesions often failed to furnish the pathogenic microbe, as
tested even by attempts at artificial cultures. The protection secured
from the antitoxins alone is shortlived, terminating with
the elimination of these elements, while that coming from the
action of the toxins on the leucocytes, and the stimulation by
these to the production of defensive products, is much more lasting
and in ratio with the quantity of the stimulus introduced and
the profundity and duration of its influence on the leucocytes.
This may partly explain the occasional early exhaustion of the
immunity and the reinfection of the animal within a year after
inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Physalix working in Chauveau’s laboratory has found the best
results from the use of weakened artificial cultures. He cultivated
the microbe of Lignieres in peptonised bouillon having 6
per cent. of glycerine, and allowed successive cultures to rest
(without reseeding a new culture fluid), after they have attained
to their full growth. The strength of the culture is in inverse
ratio to the period that elapsed between successive cultures, leading
up to this one, and the first inoculation is made with the
weakest product that will produce a very limited local swelling
which is fully developed in 48 hours, and disappears in a few days.
Three or four inoculations are made successively with cultures of
gradually encreasing potency, after which immunity persists for
years. It is to be understood, that an overdose will overcome
the immunity at any time; also that the passage of a culture of
lessened potency through a dog or Guinea pig will raise it to its
original virulence. Physalix operated only on young dogs, that
had not shed their milk teeth, and injected 2 to 3 c.c. of the
culture as a dose with only 2.5% mortality. Others had less success.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> To secure good results in the treatment of distemper
every attention must be paid to good hygiene. An open
air life in summer, and a roomy, clean, well-aired, warmed
building in winter are most important. Chills, foul air, and
filth generally are to be carefully guarded against. Food should
be moderate in amount, easily digested and nutritious. Milk is
especially good (sweet, skim or buttermilk); then biscuit and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>milk, or in patients accustomed to animal food, lean meat, minced,
scraped or pulped. Warm baths are often advantageous, but
they must be given with great caution to avoid chill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Medicinal treatment is largely symptomatic. An excessively
high temperature (104° and upward) may be met by warm
baths, or antipyretics—quinine, acetanilid, salicylate of soda, antipyrine,
phenacetin, or even damp compresses to the sides. As a
rule, however, it is not well to continue such agents as acetanilid,
antipyrine or phenacetin longer than is absolutely needful to reduce
excessive temperature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Attempts have been made to check microbian proliferation by
antiferments, such as quinine, calomel, creolin, phenol, and phenacetin.
The tonic action of quinine specially recommends it but
like all bitters it is obnoxious to a dog with a delicate stomach.
Calomel is especially recommended by Fröhner as a gastric and
intestinal antiseptic and its indirect action on the liver renders it
valuable in many cases. Creolin and carbolic acid exhaled from
saturated cloths tend to disinfect the air passages and give tone
to the mucosa. My colleague Dr. P. A. Fish gave carbolic acid, 2
per cent., and afterward 4 per cent. in normal salt solution, and
in doses of ½ to 1 drachm, subcutem once and twice a day. In
the initial stages, it seemed often to be of great value, quieting
the nervous excitement, improving the general symptoms, and in
some instances apparently cutting short the affection. Trasbot
recommended strong infusion of coffee, and Zippelius sodium
chloride, while others gave ergotin, or better hydrogen peroxide
in spray or as a draught.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Eliminative treatment.</i> As in all depressing contagious diseases,
we must favor elimination of the toxins, and in this case
without risking any material encrease of debility. Calomel (7
grs.), sodium salicylate or benzoate (4 grs.), sodium bicarbonate
(7 grs.), potassium iodide (4 grs.), chlorate (7 grs.), or nitrate
(7 grs.) may be cited. Digitalis (1 gr.), strophanthus, or
caffeine are especially recommended by their power of encreasing
the tone of the heart when that has become weak or exhausted.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the <i>respiratory</i> symptoms we may employ the antiseptic
inhalations already named, or, in place of these, iodine or sulphurous
acid. The nervous cough may be met by syrup of
poppies, or anise, by morphia, or codeia. (Recipe: morphinæ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>hydrochloras 0.1 grams: aquæ amygdal. amar. 10 grams,
aquæ distill. 150 grams. M. A teaspoonful three or more times
a day. <i>Fröhner</i>). As expectorants, ammonium chloride (5 grs),
or acetate, senega, or apomorphia (⅒ gr.), may be used. In
vigorous subjects ipecacuan (½ to ¾ gr.), or antimonial wine (1
drop). Hydrogen peroxide in doses of a teaspoonful is often
useful. Among counterirritants and derivatives the warm bath
and cold compresses are especially valuable, or tincture of iodine,
or camphorated spirit, or equal parts of aqua ammonia and olive
oil serve a double purpose as furnishing at the same time an expectorant
inhalant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Special pulmonary complications must be dealt with on general
principles as advised for the special diseases, bearing in mind
always the profound prostration and the need to avoid depressing
agents.</p>

<p class='c008'>For <i>conjunctival symptoms</i> bathing with tepid water to soothe
irritation and remove adhesions and crusts, may be followed by
a drop of aqueous solution of pyoktanin (1:1000) under each lid,
twice a day, or cocaine (3:100), or silver nitrate (½:100); may be
used. Fröhner advises creolin (½:100); Cadeac, cresyl (½:100);
Müller, mercuric chloride (1:2000) or boric acid (1:40). Other
Collyria may be substituted (see diseases of the eye). In violent
inflammations atropia will find a place and in ulcerations boric
acid, silver, pyoktanin, calomel, or hydrogen peroxide. When
irritation and rubbing are persistent a cocaine solution may be
dropped into the eye every few hours. When the ocular troubles
persist during general convalescence tonics with good nourishment
and hygiene are demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>With <i>digestive symptoms</i> the attendant vomiting will usually
have cleared the stomach of irritant contents. In the exceptional
cases it may be unloaded by apomorphia (¹⁄₁₀₀ gr. subcutem), or
ipecacuan wine a teaspoonful by the mouth. More commonly a
check must be placed on persistent vomiting by bismuth nitrate
(3 grs.), laudanum (5 to 10 drops), creosote (5 drops), or chloroform
(5 to 10 drops), and small pieces of ice. A derivative to
the epigastrium is sometimes useful. The food should be of the
simplest and most easily digested kind, milk, meat-soup skimmed
of fat, meat juice, scraped or pulped raw meat. Demulcents like
gum water, slippery elm bark, or decoction of marsh mallow may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>be resorted to, and in case of extreme irritability nourishment
may be given by rectal injection. As vomiting may be kept up by
irritants in the intestines a tablespoonful of tincture of rhubarb
may be required to be repeated twice a day until relief is secured.
Calomel and chalk (1:12) in grain doses will sometimes serve a
good purpose. Also dilute hydrochloric acid in water (1:60) in
doses of a teaspoonful with pepsin, gentian, quinine or nux
vomica will often contribute much to restore tone and function.
Septic intestinal fermentations may be met with beta-naphthol,
naphthalin, (7 grs.), chloral hydrate (10 grs.) lactic acid (buttermilk),
or salol (5 grs.). The attendant fœtid diarrhœa may
demand in addition opium or silver nitrate (½ to 1 gr.). The
gastric secretion is usually suspended so that it largely passes into
the intestines unchanged. Of course it should not be used along
with muriatic acid.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>skin eruption</i> is usually considered of little consequence,
or, by some, beneficial (Cadeac). If treatment is desired it
may consist in dusting powders, demulcent soothing dressings
and perhaps stimulating liniments as found under <i>skin diseases</i>.
It usually disappears with the elimination of the toxins and the
restoration of vigorous health.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the <i>nervous symptoms</i> treatment must correspond to the morbid
phenomena. Extreme prostration may demand diffusible
stimulants. Spasms and other indications of congestion may be
met by cold to the head, and inhalations of ether, followed by
potassium or sodium bromide (8 grs.), sulphonal (20 grs.), trional
(15 grs.) chloral hydrate in mucilage, or hypnal (15 grs.). Paralysis
must be met by tonics, stomachics, easily digestible, rich
food, and good hygiene. Pepsin, muriatic acid, nux vomica
(½ gr.), arsenite of soda solution (5 drops), arsenite of strychnia
(¹⁄₂₀ gr); orexin(3 grs.), strong coffee infusion, wine, and electricity
may be tried, in addition to stimulant liniments. Chorea must
be treated on the same corroborant plan. Cold douches after
which the patient is carefully rubbed dry are sometimes successful,
(see Chorea).</p>

<p class='c008'>During <i>convalescence</i> and in all cases of debility and anæmia a
similar corroborant treatment is demanded. Pulped raw meat,
rich soups, stomachics, tonics including the preparation of iron,
and in extreme cases transfusion of blood or a normal salt solution
may be resorted to.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>In <i>cats</i> a parallel course of treatment may be pursued, allowance
being made for the smaller size of the animal and the great
susceptibility of the feline patient to phenol.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>INFECTIOUS BRONCHIAL CATARRH. BENCH SHOW DISTEMPER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Under this name Glass describes an affection, milder than the
usual distemper, but showing similar lesions and demanding an
equivalent treatment. It is not self-limiting the same patient
having suffered twice in the same year (an occurrence which is
occasionally seen in distemper.) The incubation is 3 to 5 days.
Diarrhœa is invariably present from the first, and the fæces slimy
and at the end of a week slightly bloody. The affection is
characterized by the predominance of the digestive disorder, the
absence of skin eruption, the free shedding of the hair in long
coated animals, the ulceration of the gums, tongue and lips, and
the low mortality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bacteriological research must be invoked to determine whether
this is only a form of distemper or if it is one of a group of
diseases which have hitherto been known by that name.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EMPHYSEMATOUS ANTHRAX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Definition. Historic notes. Geographical distribution. Animals susceptible:
Young cattle after weaning, sheep, goats; horses, asses and
white rats, have local swelling; dog, cat, pig, bird and man immune. Immune
animals succumb if injected with lactic acid, or proteus vulgaris, or
violently exerted (sarco-lactic acid). Causes. Bacillus anthracis emphysematosa,
3 to 10μ by 5μ, stains violet with iodine, anærobic, sporulates in
living body, hence seen as rod, club, and round, spore. Lives in exudate,
not in blood nor on surface. Table comparing with anthrax bacillus. Vitality:
resists drying, cold, 98° F., weakened by 139°, sterilized by 212° F.
for 20 minutes, by strong antiseptics. Lives in dense clay, hard pan, and
waterlogged soils holding little oxygen. Accessory causes: lactic and
other organic acids, overwork, potash salts, alcohol, salt, proteus vulgaris,
micrococcus prodigiosa, low condition, debility, plethora, chills, change to
warmth, youth, melting snows, freshets, drying of wet lands. Symptoms:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>incubation a few hours, disease 12 to 70 hours. Hyperthermia, swelling in
loose connective tissue, shoulder, quarter, arm, thigh, neck, trunk, palate,
base of tongue, pharynx, tender point, rapidly enlarges, spreads, crepitates,
percussion resonance, finally cold, insensible, <a id='t182'></a>and withered. On incision black,
bloody pulp, or frothy. Peripheral gelatinoid exudate. Subsidiary lymph
glands enlarged. Cases with deep seated exudate. Diagnosis: from malignant
œdema and anthrax. Lesions: early decomposition, bloating, in
swelling blood extravasation with gas bubbles and lymph exudate, muscle
beneath dirty brown or black, breaking down when pressed, shows waxy or
fatty degeneration, and many leucocytes and cell forms. Lymph glands
and plexuses blood gorged. Extravasation may be in internal organs.
Liver congested. Spleen rarely enlarged. Treatment: Chloride of iron
internally, ammonia iodide and ol. terebinth externally. Scarify and use
hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate. Antitoxins. Prevention:
drain and till soil, apply quicklime to muck, exclude new animals just from
infected districts, disinfect buildings, close infected wells and streams, seclude
the sick, burn, cook or dissolve carcasses, or fence graves. Bleeding
purgation, diuresis, uniform good feeding, setoning. Immunization by
heated and sterilized culture; by toxins passed through a porcelain filter;
by minimum dose intravenously; by injection into trachea; by inoculation
on tip of tail; by inoculation with Pasteur weakened virus; by heat
sterilized virus.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Symptomatic Anthrax; Black Quarter; Quarter
Ill; Black Leg; Rauschbrand; Charbon Symptomatique.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An acute infectious bacteridian disease manifested
by hyperthermia, lameness, and a localized, hot, painful swelling
on the shoulder, quarter, leg, neck, trunk or elsewhere, tending
to emphysema, and gangrene and when incised showing black
extravasated blood, clotted or frothy.</p>

<p class='c008'>This affection was long confounded with anthrax proper, but
was differentiated by the observation of Wallraff (1856), Boulit-Josse,
Vernant, Pfisterer, Feser, and others and finally Bollinger
in 1875 found the motile bacillus. Arloing, Cornevin and Thomas
(1879–84) thoroughly substantiated this position, and devised a
method of immunizing by inoculation. Feser had however seen
the motile sinuous rods in the exudate as early as 1860, and even
produced the disease by the inoculation with mud from infected
Alpine pastures.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical distribution.</i> Emphysematous anthrax prevails
in limited areas, and particular buildings in Europe, Asia, Africa,
Australia and America, and in all climates from the tropics up
to the sub-Arctic. It is however most prevalent in spring, summer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and autumn. It is not uncommon at the breaking up of the
winter snows. It is especially prevalent on damp, undrained
land or on such as has dried up in the heats of summer, and has
become less prevalent in many localities in connection with drainage
and careful cultivation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> The disease is especially common in
young cattle, from three months to four years of age. Calves
fed on milk are rarely attacked, being in a sense carnivorous and
sometimes immunized by toxins from the dam. Cattle over four
years usually escape, having already become immune if kept in
an infected locality. If brought from a noninfected place they
are, at any age, as susceptible as the young. Sheep and goats
contract the disease only exceptionally, but like the Guinea pig
are easily infected by inoculation. Horses, asses and white rats
have only a circumscribed swelling in the seat of inoculation,
and foals and buffalo calves sometimes contract it casually.
Carnivora and omnivora, (dog, cat, pig, bird, man), and the
rabbit are virtually immune.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immune animals may, however, be made to succumb under
special treatment. In a rabbit inoculated at the same time with
the microbe of black quarter and proteus vulgaris, or micrococcus
prodigiosus, or if injected with a little lactic acid, the disease develops
promptly and fatally. Over-exertion, producing sarco-lactic
acid will also lay the system open to attack. The reduction
of the vitality and resistance of the muscle of the rabbit by
a contusion, bruise or lacerated wound, or by injecting it with
acetic acid, potash salts, alcohol, or common salt, will render the
inoculation pathogenic. Again, the introduction of the black
quarter microbe into the aqueous humor of the rabbit, where
there are so few defensive leucocytes, entails an active proliferation
and a fatal result.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The essential cause of emphysematous anthrax is a
rod-shaped germ, variously known as <b>bacillus anthracis emphysematosa</b>,
<b>bacillus Chauvæi</b>, <b>Rauschbrand bacillus</b>.
This is a rod-shaped microbe, with rounded ends, found singly
or connected in pairs, or very short filaments. The bacilli are
3 to 10µ long, by .5µ broad, or when sporulating, 1.1 to 1.3µ.
They form spores even in the body of the affected animal, often
assuming a club shape by reason of the spore formation near one
end. If the spore develops in the center they appear fusiform.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>They take aniline colors readily, and iodine slightly, assuming in
the last case a violet tint. The staining is unaffected by heating
in melted balsam. The bacillus grows readily in ordinary culture
media, (peptonized gelatine, bouillon, milk, etc.), but, being
anærobic, only under the surface in stick cultures, or under a
neutral gas or vacuum. It grows most rapidly at a temperature
of 36° to 37° C. but also as low as 15° C. The bouillon at 37°
C. becomes milky and opaque in 24 hours, and later it clears up,
the microbes being precipitated as a free white powder. In gelatine
cultures liquefaction takes place in three days, and in twenty
days the whole mass may be dissolved and the microbes precipitated
to the bottom. Spores may form in the living body and as
these are set free by the granular degeneration of the bacilli, the
virulent exudate and cultures usually show the microbe in three
different forms: 1st; the straight, motile bacillus of one thickness
throughout its whole length; 2d; club-shaped or fusiform
bacilli, the thickening of the end or median part being due to the
endogenous formation of a refrangent spore or spores; and 3d;
the free refrangent spores which have been set free by the degeneration
and destruction of the sporulating bacilli. The microbe
is not found on the surface of the living animal, nor in the
blood, for in both the supply of oxygen is too abundant; it forms
its colony under the skin, in the tissues, and above all, in the
mass of extravasated blood or gelatinoid exudate which its irritation
has produced and where air is lacking.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most marked differential features of the microbes of anthrax
and emphysematous anthrax are contrasted in the following

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span><i>Resistance of bacillus of black quarter to physical and chemical
agents.</i> The microbe is possessed of great vitality. Thoroughly
dried at a temperature of 95° F. it retains its virulence. The
spores may be preserved indefinitely in dry soil, buildings, fodder,
litter, harness, etc. Cold is equally harmless to it. It has
been exposed to a temperature of 98° F. below zero without losing
its virulence. Its virulence is lessened by exposure for an hour
to 139° F., and it is sterilized at a temperature of 212° <a id='t185'></a>F. for twenty
minutes. The dried spores are virulent after six hours of the
boiling temperature but are sterilized at 230° F. if maintained for
the same length of time. Diffused in water the virus is sterilized
in thirty-five minutes at the boiling temperature. Some waters
at ordinary temperatures destroy the virulence in twenty-four
hours; others not for many months. It is destroyed by the more
potent disinfectants, mercuric chloride (1:1000), silver nitrate
(1:100), acid salicylic (1 to 2:100), acid carbolic (2 to 4:100),
copper sulphate (20:100), boric acid (20:100), muriatic acid
(1:2). Quicklime, copperas, zinc chloride, sulphuric acid and
an alcoholic solution of phenol have proved unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c008'>In clay soils, hard pans, waterlogged soils, and in some that
are over manured so that the atmospheric air is excluded, it may
be preserved indefinitely. Feser, Gotti and others have produced
the disease by inoculating with the washings of infected marshy
soils, and this is doubtless a common source of casual cases of the
malady.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory causes</i> are important. The predisposing influence of
lactic acid, of other organic acids, and of overwork have been
already named. Potass salts, alcohol, common salt and the products
of proteus vulgaris, or micrococcus prodigiosus increase the
susceptibility. Low condition, debility, or suddenly induced
plethora have a similar influence. Sudden changes of weather,
chills, and particularly the access of hot weather in spring, when
the animal is changing its coat lays, the system open to attack.
Youth, after the period of suckling, and under three years old,
seems to increase the predisposition, though this is largely the
result of the absence of a previous exposure. Then impermeable,
clay, wet, marshy soils, or those charged with organic matter are
conditions of the presence of the microbe. It often appears in
spring in connection with the melting of the winter’s snows, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>occurrence of freshets, and the washing out of soil infection which
would otherwise remain buried. Also in advanced summer and
autumn when swamps, ponds, basins, deltas, river bottoms, etc.,
are drying out and furnishing pasture. Pease records its great
prevalence in the rainy season in the swamp districts of the Punjab
and North Western provinces of India, and the same is largely
true of our Gulf coast states.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> Emphysematous anthrax develops suddenly, the
incubation in experimental cases, lasting only for a few hours,
and the whole course of the disease does not usually exceed ½ to
3 days. The local swelling may be the first observed symptom
or there may be first febrile disturbance followed by the local
swelling. <i>The swellings</i> show where the connective tissue is
loose and abundant as on the shoulder, quarter, arm, thigh, neck,
face, or trunk, and practically never where the areolar tissue is
very spare and dense as on the end of the tail, or ear, or on the
limb below knee or hock. They sometimes form on the palate,
base of the tongue, or pharynx. The muscular system is especially
liable to suffer, the looseness of the texture and the presence
of lactic acid making a particularly favorable field for the propagation
of the microbe. The comparative absence of muscle in
the region below the metacarpus, the tail and ear is an important
cause of this immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>swelling</i> is at first very small and tender, but it encreases
rapidly, and in a few hours may extend to one, two, or three feet
in diameter. At first smooth, rounded, pitting on pressure and
destitute of crepitation on handling, it becomes softer and less
sensitive and when pressed or kneaded it gives a crepitant sensation
and sound, or it even appears to gurgle. When percussed
the resonance is drumlike. Finally, the skin may become cold,
insensible, and withered like a piece of parchment. When incised
the tissues are found to be gorged with blood, and of a
black or dark red color; they break down under pressure into a
bloody pulp, and from the wound flows a bloody fluid which may
be red in the early stages, black in the advanced, and frothy in
the latest. Where the connective tissue is very loose and abundant,
the bloody extravasation is surrounded by an extensive
straw colored œdematous infiltration. The swelling is sometimes
single, but more frequently several appear and become confluent.
The lymph glands in the vicinity become greatly enlarged.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span><i>Fever</i> is a constant condition as the swelling advances and
sometimes it precedes the local engorgement. There is erection
of the hair, with it may be, distinct shivering, recurring again
and again. Then general stiffness, dulness, prostration, loss of
appetite and rumination, accelerated breathing sometimes attended
by a grunt or moan, and rapid pulse. The temperature
usually reaches 104° F., and may rise to 109° F. The breathing
becomes more and more labored and plaintive, colicy symptoms
may set in, the prostration advances to complete adynamia, the
patient can no longer stand, the temperature drops to 100° F.,
or 98° F., and death supervenes in from eight hours to two days
from the first sign of illness.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some cases the swelling may be invisible because it is situated
deeply or it may perhaps be entirely absent, and the constitutional
symptoms are the only ones observed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> From <i>malignant œdema</i>, which it resembles in
producing gas and crepitating tumors, emphysematous anthrax
is distinguished by the greater length of the microbe, by its formation
of spores at the pole and not in the centre of the bacillus, by
the more sluggish motions of the germ, by the restriction of the
germ to given infected districts instead of being generally diffused
as in malignant œdema, by its not attacking man, rabbit, nor pigeon,
which are subject to malignant œdema, by its deadly action on
mature cattle which are usually immune from malignant œdema,
and by the abundant blood extravasation on the swelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>anthrax</i> it is distinguished by the motility of the bacillus,
by its polar sporulation and club shape, by its rounded ends, by
its absence from the blood in the earlier stages, by the presence
of gas and crepitation in the swellings, and by the deadly action
of the infection on Guinea pigs, but not on rabbit, man, nor
pigeon. Anthrax is easily inoculable on a cutaneous sore or intravenously
whereas emphysematous anthrax is not.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The carcass is liable to be bloated with gas and a
reddish, frothy liquid often escapes from mouth nose and anus.
Gas is particularly abundant in the substance of the tumor, and
the skin covering it may be dry and crackling. An incision
made into the swelling exposes a mass of blood extravasation
and lymph exudate, the blood predominating in the centre so that
it may appear clotted and black, and mixed with gas bubbles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>while the yellowish lymph forms the periphery of the tumor, yet
streaked more or less with blood, or even pink throughout. The
abundance of gas is usually in inverse ratio to the amount of
œdema. The muscles beneath or surrounded by an exudate
are of a dirty brown or black, and are disintegrated so as to
break down readily under pressure of the finger into a blackish
pulp. They are infiltrated with gas, crepitate under pressure and
assume a golden yellow color on exposure to the air. The gas is
comparatively inodorous immediately after death, being mainly
carbon dioxide and carbide of hydrogen. Later it may show distinct
and even offensive odor, from the formation of hydrogen
sulphide, or lactic acid. The muscular fibres are easily teased
apart, and show under the microscope masses of blood globules,
leucocytes, lymph cells, free nuclei and granules, with, in some
points, fatty or waxy degeneration of the fibres, or granular
masses that are stained black by osmic acid. The bacillus is
present in large numbers, and this with its absence immediately
after death from the blood becomes characteristic. The lymph
glands near the swelling are usually enlarged and gorged with
blood. The lymph plexuses and vessels contain bubbles of gas.</p>

<p class='c008'>The swellings may be subcutaneous, or submucous in the
tongue or pharynx, but they occur also in the pleuræ, lungs,
heart, pericardium, mediastinum, the peritoneum, the sublumbar
connective tissue, and even the walls of the stomach or intestine.
It is not uncommon to find a pink effusion into one of the serous
membranes. The liver is usually hyperæmic, as may be also the
kidneys, but the spleen is rarely enlarged. In this and in the
integrity of the blood globules this affection differs from anthrax.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> This disease is so often speedily fatal, cutting off
its victim in eight hours, often during the night, that no opportunity
is allowed for treatment. Even in those that survive for
two days, the affection must always be looked on as exceedingly
grave, and as little amenable to treatment. Yet much depends
upon the patient and the country. Dr. Phares in Mississippi
found that it yielded readily in many cases to ½ oz. doses of tincture
of chloride of iron every four hours, and a local application
composed of equal parts of tincture of iodine, aqua ammonia and
oil of turpentine. Galtier tells us that recoveries are frequent in
Algeria, while they are rare in France. Tisserant gives the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>recoveries as 2 per cent. It is probable that in districts and countries
where the malady is all but ubiquitous, the surviving animals
are racially immune, or they have been largely exposed and
in some degree virtually immunized at an early age.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wallraff mentions a success from applying a tight ligature
around an infected limb, above the seat of the tumor and freely
scarifying the latter so as to freely admit the air. For swellings
elsewhere, scarifications and the free application and injection of
peroxide of hydrogen or potassium permanganate (2 to 3:100)
would be rational treatment. The same agent might be given by
the mouth in doses of 2 or 3 ozs. at frequent intervals. Antiseptics
and tonics have been freely employed, including phenol,
salicylic acid, sodium salicylate, potassium iodide, quinia, alcohol,
phosphorated oil, ammonia acetate, and as an eliminant soda sulphate,
but with no very good result. Locally, scarification, antiseptics
and caustics, have been employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another line of treatment which deserves to be further exploited
is the use of antitoxins on infected animals. An immunized
animal may be again and again inoculated at intervals of a week
or two until it has been stimulated to produce antitoxin in large
amount. Then after three weeks interval its blood serum or blood,
may be sterilized by heat, the resulting coagulum washed in distilled
or boiled water, and filtered, and the filtrate injected subcutem
on the infected animal.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> This is most effectively secured by sanitation of
the soil and buildings. Thorough drainage to secure perfect and
constant æration leads to destruction of the anærobic germ, or the
suspension of its pathogenic quality. Thorough culture contributes
largely to this sanitary æration, while baking of the surface
counteracts it. When thorough drainage is impossible it may be
desirable to subject the land to gardening or to the production of
crops that are to be used for human consumption and not for
domestic animals. Kitt’s suggestion, to soil cattle on hay, produced
on such lands, and to exclude from the infected lands all
animals that by wounds or sores near the feet, or by raw gums
from shedding of teeth, furnish infection atria for the poison, is
insufficient, as stalled cattle occasionally suffer.</p>

<p class='c008'>When an open porous soil maintains the infection by reason of
the presence of an excess of decomposing organic matter, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>may be largely remedied by a free application of quick lime.
This hastens the decomposition of the organic matter and after a
year or two, when that has been largely disposed of, the good
effects may be expected.</p>

<p class='c008'>An important measure is to exclude from fairs, markets, and
above all from clay or other dense wet soils into which they might
convey the germs, all animals brought from infected soils.</p>

<p class='c008'>Disinfection of the buildings where diseased and infected animals
have been is an essential measure. Wells and streams receiving
the drainage of infected lands must be carefully avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>Diseased animals must be carefully isolated, and all their droppings,
and products of every kind disinfected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carcasses are best cremated or rendered under superheated
steam under pressure. Solution in sulphuric acid may be employed.
If none of these are available they may be deeply buried
in dry porous soil well apart from any risk of drainage into wells
or water supplies. The area occupied by the graves should be
fenced in so that no cattle nor sheep can gain access to it, and
any vegetation grown on the graves should be burned. The danger
of the germs being raised to the surface by soil water or earth
worms must be recognized and any consequent evil guarded
against. The carcass should not be cut open but buried in the
hide, or if the latter is preserved it should be treated with a chloride
of lime solution. If a carcass is opened for scientific purposes,
great care must be taken to avoid the distribution of the
bacillus in soil appropriate to its preservation. The meat should
not be preserved for human consumption unless it has been cooked
under pressure at a temperature of 240° F. The object is not
to destroy any poison which would be fatal to man, but rather to
prevent the spread of the spores on new soil and the extension
of the area of infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reduction or prevention of sudden plethora was formerly
availed of to lessen the number of victims and it is well to still
bear in mind that this has an appreciable though limited effect.
As a means of reducing plethora a free bleeding was resorted to
when the period of yearly prevalence approached, and no less
when the disease had already appeared in a herd. I can mention
an instance in which infection was carried on the fleam from the
first animal bled (the sick one) and caused the fatal infected swelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>around the phlebotomy wound in the next seven animals operated
on. Another objection to phlebotomy is the tendency to a rapid
reproduction of blood, which the depletion brings about, and the
supervention of a greater danger than before, in the course of a
month or more. Purgatives and diuretics are somewhat less objectionable
in this sense. Careful feeding to keep the animal constantly
in good condition does something to obviate sudden plethora
and its attendant dangers, and thus an allowance of grain or linseed
cake through winter and early spring, or when the pastures are
bare, will bring the animals through in fine condition, and ward
off the danger that comes from a sudden access of rich aliment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another measure was the insertion of a seton in the dewlap.
The theory was to counteract plethora but the benefit probably
came rather from the formation of an actively granulating wound,
which came in contact with the ground and received the bacillus,
but in which the abundance of air, and of active leucocytes
checked the propagation of the germ and the occurrence of a
fatal infection. A certain grade of immunity was the natural result
in many cases.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization.</i> As the first attack of emphysematous anthrax
secures for the subject of it immunity against a second, we are
furnished with a reasonable basis for the practice of artificial immunization.
This has been attained by a variety of methods, the
essential feature of each being the subjecting of the system of
the animal to be treated, to the action of the toxins of the
specific bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'>1st. A culture of the bacillus made in the thermostat at 42 C.
(107.6° F.) so as to prevent the formation of spores is then sterilized
by heating to 100° C. for one hour and then injected subcutem
in a dose of 2 drams, to be repeated on the second day.
This, like all the other methods named should be done by some
one accustomed to bacteriological manipulation and the sterilization
completed by superheating the neck of the vessel containing
the mixture. Any germs escaping on the hands, instruments or
other objects used will prove fatal in spite of all the appearance
of precautions.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. Roux sterilized his cultures by filtering them through a
porcelain (Pasteur) filter and using only the filtrate for injection.
This requires even greater precaution in manipulation as what is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>left in the filter is most virulent, and must be thoroughly sterilized
to obviate dangers from its dissemination.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d. Intravenous injection of a small quantity of virus, containing
but a few bacilli produces no local swelling, but only a
slight temporary hyperthermia and permanent immunity. The
greatest care is necessary in the manipulation, to prevent any
contact of the bacillus with the subcutaneous tissues or the walls
of the vein. The virulent exudate swarming with bacilli is taken
and a drop or two added to a normal salt solution, which is diluted
and shaken in a stoppered bottle, until each drop contains
but one, or at most two bacilli. Then the hands having been
thoroughly washed with soap and warm water and rinsed in a 5
per cent. solution of carbolic acid, and the instruments having
been boiled, the vein is raised as for bleeding, and penetrated by
a short cannula and trochar, which after boiling has been dipped
in the carbolic acid solution, the trochar is withdrawn, and the
nozzle of the syringe containing the virulent solution is inserted
through the cannula, so that its point is free in the centre of the
blood stream, into which a few drops of the virulent solution are
discharged. The nozzle is left in place for a few seconds to ensure
the washing of any infecting matter from its point, when it is
withdrawn, followed immediately after by the cannula. Great
care should be taken to avoid any scratching of the inner coat of
the vein with the cannula, trochar or nozzle.</p>

<p class='c008'>4th. Another method of immunizing is by the injection of the
virulent liquid into the trachea and bronchia. This appears to
bring it so directly in contact with the blood, that the microbes
are destroyed as rapidly as if it were introduced into the blood
stream direct. The injection is made between two tracheal rings,
the manipulation being essentially the same as in the cases of the
vein, the tissues being first perforated by a sterilized cannula and
trochar, and the sterilized nozzle subsequently inserted through
the cannula.</p>

<p class='c008'>5th. Inoculation into the tip of the tail can be successfully employed,
the coldness of the region and the scantiness of the connective
tissue preventing any dangerous increase of the bacilli in
the cooler season. In the heat of summer, however, this is to be
avoided as dangerous. The tail is first washed with soap and
water followed by a 3 per cent. solution of phenol. It is then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>punctured with a fine trochar or needle, (sterilized), within two
inches of the tip and in a downward direction and the instrument
is moved slightly from side to side so as to form a small sac, and
is then withdrawn. The sterilized nozzle of the hypodermic
syringe is now inserted in the opening and a few drops of the
virus injected into the sac. When the nozzle has been withdrawn
the thumb may be placed on the external orifice and the end of
the tail manipulated to diffuse the virus in the connective tissue.
This is usually followed by an insignificant swelling, and a slight
rise of temperature. Should the swelling exceed the size of a
duck’s egg or if others appear higher up on the tail, they may be
freely scarified and covered with a carbolic acid bandage. Or the
tail may be amputated above the highest swelling and the stump
treated with antiseptics.</p>

<p class='c008'>6th. The virus prepared by the Pasteur institutes, that of Arloing,
Cornevin and Thomas, is the most extensively employed.
Forty grammes of the diseased muscle are dried rapidly at 32° C
(90° F.) and triturated in 80 grammes of water. This is divided
in 12 equal parts and put on plates in two thermostats, six at
100° C. (212° F.) and six at 85° C. (185° F.) where they are
kept for six hours, when it forms a dry, brownish powder. One
tenth of a gramme (1½ gr.) of this powder is dissolved in five
grammes of distilled or boiled water and will furnish ten doses.
The animal to be protected is first injected in the tip of the tail or
elsewhere with the virus prepared at 100° C., and ten days later
with that prepared at 85° C.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the use of this method in hundreds of thousands of animals
on infected lands the mortality has been reduced to less than one
tenth of its former amount. It is attended by the one danger
which is not always duly appreciated, that unless its use is
restricted to herds on ground that is already infected, it endangers
the infection of new districts. The spores are not absolutely
sterilized at 85° C. Arloing and Cornevin and later, Nocard and
Roux have shown that the addition of lactic acid to the liquid
which has been weakened for inoculation, restores it to its former
virulence, making it a most deadly agent. Galtier says that the
virus weakened by heating to 100° C. for seven hours until it will
no longer kill a mature Guinea pig, will still kill a new born Guinea
pig and acquire all its original virulence in the act. Also that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>injection of large enough doses will not only kill the full grown
Guinea pig, but at the same time restore the microbes to their
former virulence. While recognizing the great economy of the
judicious use of such weakened virus, we cannot but condemn
the reckless sale by the Pasteur institutes of their products, to be
used on animals on all kinds of lands, the uninfected as well as
the infected. A great and valuable prophylactic measure should
not be used in such a way as to increase the area of prevalence of
the disease which is to be prevented, and also the yearly demands for
more of the preventive agent. This may appeal to the business
instinct, but this should ever be held subordinate to sanitary considerations.
The danger might be avoided by making the state
the sole distributor of such prophylactic agents, but in any case
their use should be forbidden, and as far as possible prevented,
upon dense and wet soils that are not yet contaminated by the
bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'>7th. Kitt secured immunization by inoculating once only,
with dried virus which had been subjected for six hours to steam
at 100° C.</p>

<p class='c008'>8th. In different outbreaks, I have taken the blood from the
sick animal, or one that has just died, and heated it for over one
hour in a water bath, at 100° C., then broken up the coagulated
mass in well boiled water, filtered the liquid and used the
filtrate for inoculation in doses of 2 drams, repeated the second
day. Great care is taken in keeping the whole mass at 100° C.
for the requisite length of time; then in heating the upper part
of the vessel, which was above the contents and the water so as
to char anything adhering to it; to see that hands, instruments,
and all articles used have been thoroughly sterilized; and to dip
the hypodermic nozzle in carbolic acid before each injection.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not claimed that this method is perfect, since severe, advanced
cases may have bacilli and even spores in the blood, and
the latter would not be sterilized but only weakened. It has,
however, several manifest advantages that may be held to more
than counterbalance this danger.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>a.</i> It almost infallibly secures the toxins of the disease prevailing
in the particular herd, thus escaping the danger of using
the weakened virus of emphysematous anthrax on some other
disease (anthrax, Wildeseuche, Barbone, etc.), which has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>mistaken for it, and which may not be prevented by this purchased
product.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>b.</i> During life the blood of emphysematous anthrax is usually
free from the microbe, and even where that is present it is liable
to be in very small numbers, so that we secure either the pure
toxins, or if a few germs are present they are so scanty, that
weakened as they are by heat, they are without danger to the
animal operated on. I have never had occasion to note evil
results.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>c.</i> There is no danger of the spread of the bacillus to new territory,
as we secure the material from a herd in the already infected
territory, and use it only on the animals on the same land.</p>

<p class='c008'>The certainty of results with this method, and the comparative
absence of danger of injury to the animal operated on, and of all
risk of the extension of the area of infection appeal to me so
strongly, that I would not willingly resort to the purchased products,
except where it proves impossible to secure the virus on the
spot.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> Anthrax is an acute infectious bacteridian disease occurring
casually in the herbivora and omnivora and, under favorable
conditions, communicable to carnivora, birds and batrachians.
Its special features are the presence of the <i>bacillus anthracis</i> in the
diseased parts, the destruction of red globules, the arrest of
hæmatosis, the occurrence of capillary embolism, extravasations
and exudations, and of necrotic processes in the affected parts,
and a sanguineous engorgement of the spleen.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Synonyms.</i> Malignant pustule; Splenic apoplexy; Splenic
Fever; Charbon; Miltzbrand; Woolsorter’s Disease; Malignant
Carbuncle; Contagious Carbuncle.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History and Geographical Distribution.</i> As anthrax prevails
in damp, undrained lands where agriculture is backward, it is
not wonderful that it can be traced to near the dawn of human
history when the whole race lived under primitive conditions.
Moses records its ravages on the bottom lands of the Nile (Ex.
ix. 9), Homer, on the plains of Troy (Iliad, Bk. 1st), Ovid,
Plutarch, Dionysius, Livy, Lucretia, Columella, Virgil, Pliny
and the Arabian physicians all show a familiarity with a disease
of this nature. Later, Heusinger collects evidence of its prevalence
in certain areas in all parts of the world from the equator
to the Arctic circle. The mortality was often very high, thus
Kirchner records the death of 60,000 people in a single epidemic
in 1617, in the vicinity of Naples, Placide-Justin, that of 15,000
in St. Domingo in six weeks in 1770, and on the Russian and
Siberian Steppes it is not uncommon for hundreds of thousands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>of domestic animals and thousands of human beings to suffer in
a single year.</p>

<p class='c008'>The geographical distribution of the disease is largely influenced
by soil and climate. On dense, impermeable clays and
hardpan subsoils, on river bottom lands, dried lake basins and
deltas, rich in organic matter, and with the air driven out by
water or gaseous fermentation products, the germ is preserved
and propagated if once introduced. Thus it is common around
the mouth of the Nile, and along the occasionally inundated
banks of the Vistula and Danube, the Spree, Oder, Elbe, Rhine,
Eure, Loire, Seine and Marne, and in England in the Fen district.
On the rich, undrained, black soils of Siberia it is extremely
prevalent and fatal. In the rich Genesee Valley, N. Y.,
the writer has seen 200 cattle in one herd and three human attendants
attacked in the course of a fortnight, and in different
meadows receiving the drainage of tanneries, the affection prevails
every summer and autumn. It is much more prevalent in
the rich lands of the Southern States and a widespread and deadly
epizoötic prevailed in Louisiana in 1896. Where the soil is
favorable, the germ may be preserved indefinitely, even in mountainous
districts, and near Los Angeles, Cal., where the disease
was introduced in imported sheep some years ago it has become
permanently domiciled, on the dry ranges which have moist
lands (Cienegas). When an outbreak occurs, the herds or flocks
are usually moved to higher soil, and the carcasses being left unburned
and unburied the infection is spreading year by year
(McGowan, Morrison).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Etiology.</i> Nothing is more certain than that the disease is due
to the introduction into the blood or tissues of the bacillus anthracis
or its spores. These microbes are always found in the anthrax
lesions and in the blood of the victim in the advanced stages.
When grown in bouillon cultures to the hundredth generation
they retain their virulence unabridged and determine the same
lesions in the animals inoculated. When the infecting culture
has been passed through a Pasteur filter the virulence is lost with
the removal of the bacilli. The fresh anthrax blood containing
bacilli but no spores when subjected to compressed oxygen (50
atmospheres) becomes noninfecting. The same liquid when
boiled proves non-virulent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Certain conditions, however, contribute to the propagation and
reception of the bacillus and these may be considered as accessory
causes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> The receptivity of the animal exposed
is of first importance. Young animals are the most susceptible.
The small rodents, the mouse, Guinea pig and rabbit are susceptible
in the order named, followed by the sheep and horse and
these again by the camel and ox. Among the wild herbivora the
goat, deer and stag have a high susceptibility. Man is less susceptible
yet contracts the disease readily by inoculation, inhalation
or ingestion. Swine and dogs are comparatively little susceptible,
yet they often contract the disease by eating the carcasses
or discharges of anthrax animals. White rats and birds are held
to be insusceptible, yet the latter contract the disease readily
when the vitality of the system has been reduced by immersing
the body in water, or giving antipyrine. A similar result is
observed in the otherwise immune frog if the body is heated
above the normal cold blooded temperature. The receptivity
may vary, however, in the same genus and species. The Algerian
sheep is virtually immune from anthrax, perhaps because its
ancestors have been so constantly exposed that only the insusceptible
strains survived. Swine, birds and carnivora may have
similarly acquired a fair measure of immunity by the survival of
the fittest. Apart from this, however, a flesh diet is to a certain
extent protective, thus Feser’s rats if fed vegetable food proved
susceptible to inoculated anthrax, while if fed on animal food they
were comparatively immune.</p>

<p class='c008'>The animal that has survived an attack of anthrax is thereafter
strongly immune. This serves to partly explain the apparent
immunity of animals bred in an anthrax district, the young animal
becoming habituated to infinitesimal doses of the toxins, conveyed
in the secretions of the uterine glands or mammæ.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Soil</i> is a factor so far as it preserves and propagates the bacillus.
As already stated, soils that are naturally wet by reason of their
impermeable character, their position on or near the water level,
their conformation in basins which dry out in late summer or
autumn, are especially favorable to preservation of the bacillus.
Again soils that are specially rich by reason of an excess of
decomposing vegetable and animal remains, or because of excessive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>manuring, tend to preserve and multiply the microbe. Rich,
flat meadows below tanneries or abattoirs, and irrigated from
these or occasionally overflowed are especially dangerous to stock
placed upon them. Soils with an alkaline reaction from the lime,
potash or ammonia present are very favorable to anthrax. Wells
receiving surface drainage are common factors in carrying infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Season</i> is a contributing factor in various ways. Damp seasons
sometimes bring the germ to the surface of the soil by the
gradual elevation of the water level, or by causing inundations
and the deposition of the bacillus on areas of pasture or forage
that were previously free, or finally by bringing the earth worms
to the surface and leading to the deposition in their casts of the
bacillus brought from the infected graves or retentive subsoils.
Dry seasons are, however, the anthrax seasons <i>par excellence</i>, as
they dry up swamps, fens, ponds, lakes, basins, deltas and bottom
lands, and render them available for pasture. The germladen
mud of these drying lands is also raised in dust and deposited
on the vegetation to be taken in by the animals. Again
on the drying basins and bottom lands the tempting green vegetation
is often pulled up by the roots with adherent, infecting
mud. For the above reasons, even in an anthrax region the malady
is most prevalent in the late summer and fall, and in certain
valleys like those of Corsica the stock is considered safe until the
dry autumn weather demands their removal to the mountains.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another reason for the summer epizoötics is found in the transference
of the germ by flies. House <i>flies</i>, horse-flies, blowflies,
mosquitoes, etc., carry the bacillus on their feet, mandibles
or piercing apparatus, and even in their stomachs (Bollinger) and
transfer it from one individual to another. It is worthy of note
that the great majority of cases of local anthrax in man occur on
the habitually uncovered parts of the body (face, neck, hands
and arms) and start from a centre like the bite of an insect.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stables</i>, <i>stable utensils</i>, <i>harness</i>, <i>shafts</i>, <i>poles</i>, <i>fodder</i> and <i>litter</i>
are familiar bearers of the virus. Butchers’ knives and wagons
and surgical instruments are further media of contagion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Certain conditions of the animal system expose it to attack.
The fever and constitutional disturbance which are caused by
<i>the extreme heats of summer and autumn</i> are strongly predisposing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>especially if alternated with frigid nights as seen on the Siberian
Steppes. <i>Privation of water</i> raises animal temperature and thus
the <i>drying up of the customary drinking places</i> becomes an important
factor. <i>Plethora</i> and <i>starvation</i> are alike predisposing,
probably by lessening the resisting power of the system. <i>Overwork</i>
and <i>exhaustion</i> predispose, as Roger showed by making the
immune white rat turn a wheel until worn out and then successfully
inoculating it. The addition of lactic acid to the virulent
liquid (1:500) greatly encreases its potency (Arloing, Cornevin
and Thomas) and the further addition of fermentescible sugar
and rest enhances this still more (Kitt). The production of lactic
acid by muscular overexertion is thus a potent accessory cause
in fatigue.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacillus anthracis.</i> This was first demonstrated in anthrax blood
and exudates by Pollender and Brauel in 1849 and 1850 but as they
failed to find it in all cases they concluded that it was not the essential
cause. Davaine who found the bacilli in 1850 suspected that
they were pathogenic and by 1863 he had shown that blood which
contained no bacilli was non-virulent, while that in which these
organisms were present was constantly infecting. Klebs and
Tiegel in 1871 filtered anthrax blood through an earthenware
vase and found that the clear filtrate (bacillus-free) was noninfecting.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>bacillus anthracis</i> as found in the blood is a nonmotile rod-shaped
organism, 5 to 20μ long by 1 to 1.5μ broad with ends
apparently square, but really slightly cup shaped as seen in the
stained specimens when two have remained connected end to end.
Under favorable conditions a clear hyaline envelope may be seen
around the bacillus. Though usually isolated in the living blood,
yet in bouillon cultures the bacilli grow out into long flexible filaments,
made up of separate segments which are easily distinguished
in the stained specimen. In all cultures out of the
living animal body, in the presence of air and at a suitable temperature
spores form endogenously in the bacilli and are set free
by the granular degeneration of the latter. In peptonized bouillon
this may occur in four days at 14° C., or in eight hours at 37° to
40° C., but not above 42° C. (Schreiber. Centr. S. Bact. 1896).
Sporulation never occurs in the living animal body.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacillus is ærobic, yet it will grow at the bottom of a stick
culture in solid media. It fails to grow in an atmosphere of CO<sub>2</sub>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>H, or N. It stains readily in aniline colors, and also by Gram’s
method. It grows freely on a variety of culture media (blood
serum, aqueous humor, urine, vegetable infusions, milk, meat
bouillon, peptonized gelatine, potatoes, etc.) at a temperature of
20° to 38° C. Growth ceases below 12° C., and above 45° C.
Growth is most active in neutral or slightly alkaline media, and
is arrested by that which is decidedly acid.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Action of physical and chemical agents on the bacillus anthracis.</i>
The bacilli survive a temperature of −45° C. (−49° F.), but they
perish in 10 minutes at a temperature of 100° C. (212° F). A
temperature of 55° C. (131° F.), proves fatal if sufficiently prolonged.
The spores are much more resistant. They have survived
−130° C. (−202° F.) and though they may die in 10 minutes
in liquid media kept at 95° C. (203° F.), yet when old and dry
it may require several hours at 140° C. (282° F.) to sterilize
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the bacilli are comparatively resistant to ordinary disinfectants,
and, as spores form in the body very rapidly after death,
and in virulent products, it is always best to assume their presence.
In a moist medium Cl. 44.7% destroyed the spores in 3
hours: HCl (1:1100) in 2 hours: HgCl (1:1000) in a few
minutes: HgI<sub>2</sub> (1:20000) in 2 hours: Malachite green (1:40,000)
in 2 hours: Methyl violet (1:5000) in 2 hours: Aseptol
(1:10) in 10 minutes: Carbolic acid (4:100) with HCl (2:100)
in 1 hour.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Action of septic ferments on the bacillus anthracis.</i> Rapid putrefaction
in the anthrax carcass which has not been opened tends to
speedy granular degeneration and death of the bacillus anthracis,
so that the blood and tissues may be no longer infecting after six
days in summer. In such cases the irrespirable gaseous products
of decomposition drive out the oxygen without which the bacillus
cannot live. If, however, spores have already formed or if air is
freely admitted the infection survives in spite of decomposition.
The search for the bacilli may thus be fruitless as soon as decomposition
is well advanced and the material can only be virulent
through any spores that may have formed. Eventration serves
to retard sepsis and admit air to form spores, and salting operates
in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>The infected hides, the nasal, buccal, kidney and bowel discharges,
and spilt blood and exudates mingling freely with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>air tend to form spores and to preserve and propagate the contagion.
On the contrary prompt and deep burial, without opening
the carcass and before spores can have formed will usually ensure
its destruction. The main danger in such cases comes from infecting
matter (adherent to the surface of the body) which sporulates
easily. This serves to explain the great danger of working
in anthrax hides, leather, horn, wool, hairs and bristles. It also
explains sporulation and preservation of infection when the virulent
excretions, blood, etc., mix with the surface layers of soil.
This may happen at a greater depth (3 or 4 feet) in a very porous
soil and where the temperature is sufficiently elevated (above
14° C.) It may even occur in water. The dried spores are
mostly carried in dust, hay, fodder, and running streams.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since 1892 anthrax has prevailed along the banks of the Delaware
river for a distance of 40 miles in N. J. and Del., destroying
from 70 to 80 per cent of the farm stock. The great morocco industry
on this river draws infected hides from India, China, Russia,
Africa and South America, and the spores are carried and
distributed by the tides.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Infection-Atria.</i> Infection may occur by a variety of channels
as: 1st, by <i>ingestion</i>, giving rise most commonly to anthrax of
the mouth, throat or intestines; 2d, by <i>inhalation</i>, giving rise
to pulmonary anthrax (wool-sorter’s disease): 3d, by <i>inoculation</i>
through contact of abrasions, wounds, etc., with infecting bodies,
including surgical instruments: 4th, by flies and other insects:
and 5th, by transmission to the fœtus in utero. This last form
is very rare in the larger animals, but has been repeatedly seen
in Guinea pigs, rabbits, goats and even in one case (Pangalli) in
man.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Forms of Anthrax in Domestic Animals.</i> In the lower animals
anthrax manifests itself differently according to the seat of invasion
and the amount of the virus. The worst forms, seen especially
in cattle and sheep, are so sudden that they have been
called <i>apoplectic</i> or <i>fulminant</i>. Without premonitory symptoms
there is sudden loss of appetite, trembling, haggard expression
of face, uneasy shifting of the feet, irregular movements backward
or to one side, dyspnœa, cyanosis, plaintive cries, convulsions,
ejection of blood by the nose or with urine or fæces, and
death in a time varying from a few minutes to four hours. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>second type is the <i>anthrax fever</i>, known also as <i>splenic fever</i>,
<i>splenic apoplexy</i>, or <i>internal anthrax</i>. In this form there may
be prodromata, especially in sheep, excitability, restlessness, and
above all, a rise of temperature of often 3° or 4°. There may be
distillation of drops of blood from the nose, eyes or ears, the mucosæ
become congested, and in sheep this may show on the finer
parts of the skin, as inside the forearm or thigh. Tremors, erection
of the hairs, dulness, prostration, lagging behind the flock
or herd, insensibility of the loins to pinching, inappetence, ardent
thirst, grinding of the teeth, colics, tympany, mucus coated,
bloody or liquid fæces, bloody urine, tumultuous heart beats,
dyspnœa, dark, congested mucosæ, amounting to cyanosis, and
spasmodic contractions of the muscles of the back, neck or eyes.
If blood is drawn it may appear abnormally dark in color and very
slow to brighten under the action of the air, it may have a thick,
tarry appearance, and form a very loose clot. Death, (usually
in coma or convulsions) will supervene, in sheep under 24 hours,
in cattle in 2 to 5 days, and in horses in 1 to 6 days. The third
type is the <i>local</i> or <i>external anthrax</i>, assuming in cattle the
special forms of <i>gloss-anthrax</i>, <i>pharyngeal anthrax</i>, <i>hœmorrhoidal
anthrax</i>, <i>cutaneous</i> and <i>subcutaneous anthrax</i>. In horses most of
the same forms appear, in the tongue, throat, neck, shoulders,
withers, flank or thigh. These swellings have a firm or doughy
feeling, are comparatively and sometimes wholly insensible and
show a marked tendency to necrotic changes. When incised
they show extensive blood extravasation, or a pale, straw-colored
exudate mixed with sanguineous lines or patches, and manifest
no tendency to suppuration, nor to emphysematous crepitation.
These features distinguish them from phlegmon and emphysematous
anthrax. When suppuration ensues it is tardy and indolent
and is, on the whole, a favorable indication. In all cases the bacillus
may be found on microscopic examination of the exudate.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> Putrefaction of the carcass is usually rapid. In the
very rapidly fatal cases the changes in the blood and tissues are
often little marked, and after the removal of the enlarged, engorged
spleen and infiltrated internal organs, the carcass might
often be placed on the market without much suspicion. In more
prolonged cases the blood is profoundly changed, being very
dark, not subject to rapid æration, and incapable of coagulating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>firmly or at all. The red globules are crenated or otherwise distorted,
adhere to each other in irregular masses, and have parted
with much of their hæmoglobin which diffused in the serum
stains the intima of the blood vessels and other white tissues.
The leucocytes are relatively very much encreased. The bacteria
are easily found in the intervals between the globules. The heart
is often soft, discolored, as it were parboiled, with the endocardium
deeply stained and the contained blood dark and diffluent or
liquid. The liver is usually enlarged, softened, friable, and as
if parboiled, with many hæmorrhagic patches. The spleen is
materially, often enormously enlarged, irregular in outline from
extreme engorgement with blood, and in exceptional cases even
ruptured. An encrease to two or three times the normal is
common. The bacilli are present in great numbers in the spleen,
alike in the pulp, in the blood vessels and in the trabeculæ.
The lymph glands are almost always hyperæmic, hypertrophied,
and softened, especially in the vicinity of the localizations of the
tissue lesions. They may be merely petechiated, or they may
seem like a mass of black blood, and under pressure may break
down readily into a sanguineous pulpy mass. Like the spleen
they are favorite centres for the accumulation of the bacilli.
The marked alterations in these glands will often indicate the
channel by which the infection entered the body. The serosæ
are usually hyperæmic, with many hæmorrhagic points and even
extensive exudations, and they often enclose a sanguineous liquid.
The hyperæmia and points or patches of extravasation are to be
found in any part of the body in which the bacilli have been
colonized, thus they are common in the tongue, the throat, the
lungs, the stomach or bowels, the mesentery, the omentum, the
skin, the connective tissue, or the muscular system. There may
be bloody or gelatinoid exudation, but there are always the
capillary embolisms by irregular masses of blood globules, and
bacilli. These embolisms, the arrest of hæmatosis and the destructive
action of the toxins on the red globules go far to account
for the extreme fatality of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Morbid poisons.</i> Hoffa found in anthrax cultures a ptomain
which killed with anthrax symptoms. Hankin obtained a deadly
albumose which in small doses procured immunity. Brieger and
Fraënkel separated a toxalbumin, and Martin too, a protalbumose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and a deuteralbumose together with a ptomain. Marmier separated
a toxin which did not give the reactions of the albuminoids,
albumoses, peptones nor alkaloids. This was not poisonous in
small doses, to animals possessing immunity—natural or artificial.
It was weakened but not destroyed by 110° C., and was
rendered harmless by treatment with alkaline hypochlorites. Immunity
could be induced by its use in small non-fatal doses. This
is present in the bacilli and being soluble in water can be secured
from these by diffusion in watery fluids and especially so if aided
by heat.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> The implanted bacillus begins at once to multiply
in the tissues, but the encrease is at first slow and the resulting
morbid phenomena slight, so that there appears to be a period of
incubation. In experimental inoculations in which this can be
certainly noted it extends from one to two and even three days in
the rabbit and Guinea pig, from two to four days in sheep, and
from three to six days in horses and cattle. It may be shortened
by giving an overdose and especially if this is introduced intravenously,
the chemical poisons apparently acting at once. In
young animals, too, the period is shortened, unless they have been
rendered refractory by a milk diet or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> These vary according to the species affected, and
the seat of the disease, general or local, <i>internal</i> or <i>external</i>. In
the latter case the febrile and constitutional disturbance is delayed.
In the <i>internal</i> cases the fever is early and of a high type.
Even before the animal appears to be seriously ill, while still
keeping with the herd and showing life and vigor, there may be
high temperature, 104° to 106° F., pulse and breathing accelerated,
heart beats tumultuous, tremors or shivering or perhaps only
staring coat, anorexia, and grinding of the teeth. Later
there may be drooping head and ears, dulness, a disposition
to lie, apathy, stupor and somnolence. Nervous excitement
and delirium have been noticed. The patient becomes weak,
especially behind, comatose, and the temperature declines to,
it may be, 97° or even 94° F., prior to death. The visible
mucosæ becomes dusky, brownish or yellowish, and streaks
of blood may appear in the nose or elsewhere. The urine
may be red, the fæces covered with mucus, or blood streaked, and
the rectal mucosa of a violet tinge, or blackish and blood gorged.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>In this the vulvar mucosa often participates. Local swellings
may appear in the tongue or pharynx, even if not on the surface,
or colics indicate implication of the digestive organs. The examination
of the blood early reveals the presence of the bacillus, and
as the disease advances, its black, incoagulable, tarry, or coffee-grounds
appearance becomes characteristic. Pregnant animals
are liable to abort. Death occurs in 12 to 48 hours. Most cases
are fatal at the beginning of an outbreak, while later the great
majority often recover.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fulminant cases</i> (Anthrax acutissimus) occur mostly in cattle
or sheep, in high condition, the victim being found dead in pasture
or stall, without previous observation of illness, or, if seen
during life there is the sudden attack, leaving food, muscular
tremors, anxious expression of countenance, hyperthermia,
dyspnœa, dark red mucosæ, it may be streaks of blood on them,
plaintive cries, rolling of the eyes, spasms or coma, and death in
a few minutes to one or two hours. In <i>sheep</i> there may be separation
from the flock, pawing, stretching, shaking of head, turning
in circle, dyspnœa, falling, convulsive struggling, passing of
blood by nose, kidneys or bowels and death.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Local Anthrax in Cattle. Symptoms.</i> In <i>cutaneous anthrax</i>
the circumscribed swellings appear suddenly, and may grow to
considerable dimensions on different parts of the skin, head, neck,
breast, shoulders, abdomen, axilla, sheath, udder, or flanks.
There may be one or many, and they lack the acute early tenderness,
and later crepitation of black quarter. On white skins
they are dark red, or violet, and when incised, show a gelatinoid,
bloody, non-suppurating mass, abounding in bacilli.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Gloss-anthrax</i> implicates the whole, or it may be the roots
only, of the tongue and the fauces. There is profuse salivation,
perhaps bloody, intermaxillary and pharyngeal swelling, anorexia,
and the tongue is found protruding, swollen, violaceous, vesiculated
or with rounded nodules, or sloughs and ulcers, with lardaceous
or blood stained bottoms. Hyperthermia and constitutional
symptoms are present.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pharyngeal anthrax</i> is manifested by swelling of the throat,
profuse salivation more or less marked with blood, complete dysphagia,
attending on the marked febrile and constitutional symptoms
already described.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span><i>Hæmorrhoidal anthrax</i>, a common complication of the constitutional
disease, is manifested by infiltration, blood extravasation,
violet discoloration and often enormous swelling of the rectal
mucosa, seen mainly during straining, but sometimes also as a
constant protrusion.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Local Anthrax in Sheep and Goats.</b> External anthrax
swellings may form on the face, throat or udder with the general
characters of those of the ox, but this form is much more rare
than in cattle and horses. The usual form is the internal one,
with engorgement of spleen, liver, and perhaps some other internal
organ, and it is relatively very fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Local Anthrax in the Horse.</b> <i>Symptoms.</i> In anthrax districts,
tumors form in the seats of inoculations on sores, insect
bites, or sometimes without apparent local cause, as a result perhaps
of a general infection. The infiltration takes place suddenly
into or beneath the cutis, mostly on the head, tongue, throat,
neck, breast, shoulder, inguinal region, mammæ, croup, or thigh,
encreases rapidly, but without crepitation, or suppuration, the
incision showing the general characters described in the ox, and
early attended by the constitutional disorder. The general fever
is often later in developing, less intense, and, on the whole, less
fatal than the purely internal forms.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Anthrax in Swine.</b> <i>Symptoms.</i> Swine are, on the whole,
less susceptible than cattle, and on the strength of his laboratory
experiments Pasteur denied their susceptibility. The mistake
gained a wide acceptance, yet experienced practitioners knew
that they were occasionally infected by eating the carcasses or
droppings of anthrax cattle. I had seen a number of swine die
in common with cattle in an outbreak at Swineshead, Lincolnshire,
in 1863, and a like occurrence took place in East Lothian,
and similar cases are reported by McFadyean, Trombitas and
Von Ratz, while Crookshank and Perroncito have respectively
inoculated the pig with success. In my experience at East
Lothian a shepherd skinned an anthrax bullock and then castrated
several litters of pigs, all of which died of anthrax. Much
doubtless depends on the condition of the animal as regards food
(flesh or vegetable), the presence of lactic or other organic acid,
the coincidence of infection with anthrax bacillus and one of
those conditions, which habitually enhances its virulence. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>may be named venesection (Rodet) or its counterpart anæmia,
the presence in the blood of inert powders—precipitates (Bardach),
fatigue—sarco-lactic acid (Charrin and Roger), starvation—dyspepsia
(Canalis and Morpurgo), privation of water (Pernice
and Alessi), the products of previous or coincident illness
(Galtier).</p>

<p class='c008'>The pig, infected by ingestion, suffers especially from pharyngeal
and intestinal anthrax. There is marked swelling of the
throat with stiffness, dysphagia, champing of the jaws, salivation,
frothing about the lips tinged with blood, dark, violet discoloration
or ulceration of the fauces and tonsils, retching, vomiting,
hoarseness of grunt, extension of the swelling to the face, with
petechial spots and patches, diarrhœa with frothy or bloody fæces,
great muscular weakness, a disposition to lie, it may be actual
paraplegia, with the usual accompaniments of hyperthermia, constitutional
disorder, cyanosed, or dusky brown, reddish or yellowish
mucosæ, and the black, incoagulable blood, with destruction
of the red globules.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Anthrax in Dogs.</b> <i>Symptoms.</i> In the outbreak at Swineshead,
Lincolnshire, in which the pigs suffered, one shepherd dog
contracted the disease from eating the carcasses. It took the
pharyngeal and intestinal form, with dysphagia, vomiting, bloody
diarrhœa and high fever. Straus found that young puppies were
very susceptible and old dogs refractory probably because of flesh
diet and exposure. The excision of the spleen encreased the
susceptibility to 76 per cent. instead of 20 per cent. (Bardach).
Cornevin saw 5 dogs die the same night out of 7 that ate from an
anthrax carcass. Much depends on the previous exposure and
existing condition of the dog.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cats</i> have been observed to suffer under similar conditions. At
Geneseo in 1877 I found that a cat and three young horses died
from licking the blood from a stoneboat on which an anthrax
hide had been carried.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Anthrax in Birds.</b> <i>Symptoms.</i> Birds (chickens) are naturally
less susceptible than swine, yet they succumb readily to
inoculation, when the body has been cooled by partial immersion
in cold water. Caplewsky found that, apart from artificial
chilling, young pigeons of certain breeds were easily infected,
and Œmler successfully inoculated small birds, sparrows, finches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>canaries, yellow hammers, red breasts. The larger birds are more
resistant but succumb readily if dosed with chloral hydrate, or
antipyrin (Wagner). Birds of prey seem to be immune.</p>

<p class='c008'>In chickens the disease is very acute, of rapid progress and
fatal. A few hours after inoculation they are seized with dulness,
debility, sunken head, drooping wings and tail, ruffled feathers,
and dark red or black discoloration of comb and wattles. Dark
colored anthrax swellings may appear on these last, on the eyes,
tongue, palate or feet, and the obstruction of breathing may cause
general cyanosis. Weakness is extreme, the bird staggers or is
unable to rise, has violent tremors or convulsions, with bloody
diarrhœa and perishes after a few hours or a day’s illness. The
presence of anthrax in the locality, or in other species, will be to
some extent a safeguard against confounding chicken cholera,
entero-hepatitis or malignant œdema with this affection. The
crucial diagnosis is based, as in other animals on the discovery of
the characteristic bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Differential Diagnosis.</i> The suddenness of the attack, hyperthermia,
dusky, cyanotic, petechiated mucosæ, the escape of
blood from mucous surfaces, the dark, tarry blood, brightening
imperfectly on exposure to the air, its comparatively loose
coagulum, the crenation and destruction of red globules, the
staining of the serum with hæmatoidin, the leucocytosis, the engorged,
enlarged liver and spleen, and the gelatinoid or bloody
swellings, not gasogenic as in blackquarter or malignant œdema,
together present a picture which is strongly suggestive of
anthrax. If the malady affects domestic animals generally, is
especially virulent in cattle, sheep and horses, and attacks even
man; if the district is subject to anthrax, or of a rich damp soil
which would be favorable to the preservation of bacillus anthracis;
if it is in the line of watershed from stock markets, abattoirs,
tanneries, rendering works, glue factories, packing houses,
sausage factories, or phosphate works; if forage or new stock has
been introduced from an anthrax district; and if the outbreak
has taken place with a high water level, or during a dry hot
season the case for anthrax will be strengthened.</p>

<p class='c008'>The final tests are, however, by the microscope and inoculation.
To discover the bacillus a power of 400 to 500 diameters is desirable.
From the living animal take a drop of blood, exudate, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>hæmorrhagic extravasation, make a thin film on a cover glass by
drawing across it the straight edge of another one, dry the film,
then pass it three times through the alcohol flame film downward,
stain in anilin dies, or clear with acetic acid and examine. The
bacillus is large (5 to 20µ by 1 to 1.5µ), nonmotile, of uniform
thickness throughout, and sharply cut off at the ends. The
bacillus of blackquarter is shorter, often club-shaped because of
a spore in one end, has rounded ends, is flagellate, motile and
gasogenic. That of malignant œdema is much thinner, has
rounded ends, sluggish movements and is gasogenic. The
bacillus subtilis (hay bacillus), is short, thick, with rounded ends
each bearing a flagellum and is motile. The proteus vulgaris
(common septic saprophyte) is small, short, with rounded ends,
and very active movements. If the subject is dead we may
examine the blood, or the scraping from the cut surface of the
spleen, liver, kidney, congested lymph gland or other part bearing
the lesion.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we find in the carcass exudates gelatinoid or bloody
(especially the latter), petechiæ, dark, uncoagulated blood,
brightening little on exposure, blood gorged spleen, congested or
hæmorrhagic condition of one or more internal organs, muscle or
connective tissue, (particularly of the lymph glands), if the
muscles of the loins, quarters, thighs, diaphragm or elsewhere,
are soft, as if parboiled or salmon-colored, clammy, friable, or if
reddish, yellowish, brownish, with petechiæ, and capillary
embolism the case will require critical examination. If the first
examination fails to show the bacilli, repeat it from different
lesions until thoroughly satisfied of their absence, or until another
cause for the condition has been discovered. The blocking of
the capillaries with bacilli in the various lesions is a most important
point, never to be overlooked.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of uncertainty, inoculation of a Guinea pig, mouse or
rabbit should be made. The blood or scraping from the seat of
a lesion is made into an emulsion if necessary, and injected subcutem.
A single bacillus will destroy a mouse or Guinea pig in
from one to four days, and the blood shows the characteristic
bacilli.</p>

<p class='c008'>One must, however, exclude the possibility of septic bacteria,
excluding or obscuring the bacillus anthracis, by taking the inoculating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>material from the blood of the living animal, or from the
same or the tissues as shortly after death as possible. Fifteen hours
may be altogether too late for inoculation. To exclude the anærobic
bacteria of black quarter, malignant œdema and septic affections,
make an emulsion of the suspected material in sterilized
water, filter through a boiled cloth and inject a strong dose into
the auricular vein of a rabbit. The anærobic bacteria perish in
the blood and if anthrax bacilla are present they are found in
pure cultures.</p>

<p class='c008'>In inoculating suspected water or infusion of forage the intravenous
method should be adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another resort is to make two artificial cultures, one in free air,
and the other in an atmosphere of nitrogen or carbon dioxide.
The bacillus anthracis develops in the first, the anærobes in the
second.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis. Mortality.</i> Fulminant cases are uniformly fatal.
<i>Acute intestinal</i> cases are usually fatal in 70 to 90 per cent. of the
subjects at the beginning of an outbreak. Toward the decline
most cases may recover. In a herd of 200 head, at Avon, N. Y.
in 1875, 40 fat bullocks died in two weeks, and 50 more showed
a marked hyperthermia, yet under a change of pasture, and antiseptics,
all but two of the latter recovered. As serving to identify
the disease, three attendants suffered from malignant vesicle, but
recovered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>SUPPRESSION AND PREVENTION OF ANTHRAX IN HERDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Less simple or easy than in plagues. Germ survives in soil and water.
Extinction not always possible. Killing: conditions demanding it: when
unwarranted. Kill without shedding blood, or opening carcass. Body
burned: if buried, 5 feet deep, in porous soil, distant from wells, ponds,
and rivers. Fence graves, burn grass. Disinfection of hides, litter, fodder,
manure, excretions, stalls, etc.: of bodies that must be moved, of buildings,
yards, utensils, etc. Isolation of unaffected on porous soil; surveillance.
Sales interdicted. Milk, butter, cheese. Immunization: by toxins which
stimulate leucocytes to form defensive products: antitoxins. Eosinophile
cells, action of spleen, and liver. Mellituria. Protection by a minimum
dose: by weakened virus—modes of lessening potency, Pasteur’s “vaccine”,
its drawbacks and dangers, its technique; by soluble toxins in sterile solution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>author’s experience, apparent failures, advantages. Drainage—Æration
of land. Prevention of importation and diffusion. Therapeutic treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prevention of anthrax in animals is equally important for the
sanitation of herds and human beings. It involves the purging
from the anthrax bacillus of the infected lands and the drinking
supplies, and in this respect the disease is much less amenable
to thorough and speedy extinction than is a simple plague in
which the germ does not live and multiply outside the animal
body. In some localities the extinction of the germ may be confidently
counted on and secured; in others, it may be impossible
and other measures of protection must be resorted to.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Killing of the Sick and Disposal of the Carcass.</i> This is not
always so imperative as in the obligatory parasitic infections,
since the destruction of the sick, still leaves the germ present in
the soil and water. If, however, the infection has just been introduced,
on hitherto uninfected soil, by the arrival of new animals,
and, if the new location is in any way favorable to permanent
colonization by anthrax bacillus, and, if the diseased and
suspected animals cannot be kept secluded so as to absolutely exclude
these dangers, or again, if the diseased herd or its remnant
is to be moved on to another locality, slaughter is the obvious
sanitary measure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The animal should be killed on the premises to avoid the danger
of scattering the infectious discharges in transit; it must not be
bled, nor cut open, as the admission of air determines the formation
of the resistant spore; and the carcass must be burned,
boiled, or rendered in superheated steam under pressure, or
finally dissolved in strong mineral acids. If buried, it must be
in open, porous soil, well apart from any well, pond, river, or
bank where the liquids may leach out, and the body must be
wholly covered to a depth of at least five feet. The graves must
be well fenced in from all stock, for a number of years, and no
forage grown on them can be safely fed to animals, as the bacillus
can be brought to the surface by earth worms. I have known
cattle to become infected through licking the fluid which escaped
above a stratum of clay, on the deep bank of a river, at some
little distance from where an anthrax carcass was buried in the
surface sandy loam. A covering of coal tar, chloride of lime or
of sand charged with sulphuric acid is an admirable precaution.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>As a measure of economy the skins may be removed, if at once,
on the spot, plunged for 12 hours in a 5 per cent. solution of carbolic
acid, or cresyl, or creolin, or in a two per cent. solution of
sulphuric acid, and, if the knives and other implements used are
placed in boiling water for half an hour. The same will apply
to fleeces.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Disinfection.</i> All litter, fodder, manure, urine, and other excretions,
or products; all stalls, feeding troughs, sheepfolds,
covers, halters, harness, wagons, poles, shafts, and other objects
used about the animals, or soiled by them or their products,
should be disinfected by burning, flaming or scalding (boiling),
when applicable, by one of the above-named disinfectants, by
mercuric chloride (5:1000), by formalin, or other potent antiseptic.
Extensive dung heaps, too wet to burn, may be sprinkled
freely with strong mineral acids, or mercuric chloride in solution,
piled into compact mass, covered with chloride of lime, and finally
with a thick layer of earth, and fenced in from all stock.</p>

<p class='c008'>If carcasses must be moved to the grave, rendering works, or
elsewhere, they should be sponged with carbolic acid solution,
formalin, or mercuric chloride, and each of the natural openings
firmly plugged with tow or cotton soaked in the same material,
so that no infecting material may drop on the way. They should
on no account be dragged on the ground, but carried on a wagon
or stone boat, which should be afterward carefully disinfected.
Men or animals, entering an infected place, should be disinfected
on leaving; especially hands and feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>All roads, yards, and pastures where the sick have been, and,
above all, where manure, urine, or saliva has fallen, should be
subjected to thorough disinfection, or the surface layer removed
and deeply buried. Where available, a concrete or asphalt floor
should be placed in the buildings.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Isolation. Movement from Infected Ground.</i> It has long been
known that the movement of an infected herd from the contaminated
pasture to another, will often, at once, check the development
of new cases. In Sardinia and Auvergne the flocks and herds
were yearly moved on the approach of autumn, from the rich
valley, and bottom lands, to the drier hill pastures, to avoid or
lessen the decimation that otherwise inevitably overtook them.
This is in keeping with the enzoötic nature of the malady which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>arises more from the microbe preserved in the soil than from the
sick animal direct. Two precautions are necessary in making
such a change of locality: 1st, Animals already infected should
not be moved on such new pasture; and 2d, the pasture to which
the stock is moved should be entirely free from the impermeability
(clays, hard pans), and saturation with water (swamps,
basins, low bottoms), which would ensure the permanent preservation
of any microbe planted there. Elevated, sandy, argilaceous
or loamy soils are to be selected. To these the animals of the
infected herd which by their appearance and thermometry may be
pronounced sound, should be removed, and kept under careful
supervision, especially as regards thermometric tests. Any showing
symptoms of anthrax should be at once taken back to the
infected herd. If they have stood in stalls, for milking or otherwise,
these should be disinfected, and they should be carried in
wagons, or driven by unfrequented roads. Their droppings
should be carefully disinfected.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, in the absence of anthrax symptoms, animals must be kept
in the infected lot, or returned to it, they should be immunized.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Interdiction of Sales.</i> No animal in the infected herd which
shows a rise of temperature, should be sold even for slaughter.
No animal should be sold for stock purposes until the disease has
completely subsided. Any animal in the infected herd, which
shows no hyperthermia nor other sign of anthrax, may be sold
for immediate slaughter, subject to a critical expert examination
of the cadaver for anthrax. Milk, the product of an infected
herd, and butter and cheese made from such milk, should not be
used as food. If those members of the herd, that show no hyperthermia
or other symptom of anthrax, can be held apart as a
separate herd, in a disinfected place and under careful thermometric
observation, their dairy products may be used.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization.</i> A number of different methods have been
practiced of rendering animals refractory to the bacillus anthracis,
but all are apparently based on the production in the system of
defensive products, as the result of a nonlethal poisoning with
anthrax toxins. It is true of anthrax as of many other infections
that a first attack protects against a second. In all animals there
is a certain measure of defensive power against the bacillus anthracis,
amounting in some cases to virtual immunity and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>others having a very little effect. The object in immunizing is to
stimulate to the increase of these defensive products in quantity
or power until an ordinary dose of the bacillus will fail to colonize
the tissues or the blood. In considering this subject a clear
distinction must be made between the simple bactericidal and the
antidotal or antitoxic products found in the serum of immune
animals and the toxins which are produced by the bacilli. The
soluble antitoxic and bactericidal agents found in the serum of
the immune, may be employed for therapeutic purposes to preserve
life in an animal which has received a lethal dose of the
bacillus anthracis, but as these are rapidly eliminated from the
system, their protective power is very short lived, and if some
bacilli survive the period of their presence and potency, or if they
are introduced into the system later, the animal may fall a victim
to anthrax as if no such protective agent had been used. Behring
showed that the blood serum of the white rat proves fatal to the
bacillus anthracis, but Metchinkoff pointed out later that it must
be brought in contact with the bacillus in order to prove effective,
whereas if the serum and bacillus were injected at different parts of
the body no protection was obtained. The antidotal or bactericidal
action of the serum of an immunized animal acts at once, whereas
a permanent immunity cannot be established before about fifteen
days. The serum of the immune animal contains the following
elements antagonistic to anthrax: <i>Antitoxin</i> or <i>leucomain</i> which
may be poisonous to the bacilli, or chemical antidotes to their
products: <i>globulicidal principles</i> which distort or disintegrate the
blood globules and release their contents including the bactericidal
nuclein, and probably others. All such agents when injected
into the system are present only for a limited time and while
they may be made subservient to a temporary immunity, they can
give no permanent protection and must be considered mainly as
therapeutic agents.</p>

<p class='c008'>A permanent immunity must depend on a stimulation or education
of the system to the production of these protective agents
<i>de novo</i> or in increased quantity. This must be done by exposure
of the tissues to the toxins of the bacillus anthracis, and is accomplished
slowly. Precisely what tissues are stimulated to the
production of the defensive agents is not fully known, though certain
indications may be drawn from observant facts. The eosinophile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>cells of the blood are presumably important factors as the
natural sources of the leucomaines. The spleen as the seat of important
blood changes and as preëminently the seat of election of
internal anthrax is probably involved. The dogs from which
Bardach had removed the spleen were found to be three times as
susceptible to anthrax as were the dogs that had not been operated
on. Leo’s rats, in which he had produced mellituria by the
administration of phloridzin were found to be much more susceptible
to anthrax. The liver is also a favorite seat of election of
internal anthrax. The products of the healthy liver, are probably
in some measure protective.</p>

<p class='c008'>No matter where the defensive products are formed, the practical
problem is to secure their production without imperilling life.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>By Minimum Dose.</i> Chauveau and Colin secured this in the
larger animals by intravenous injection of a minimum dose,—one
or two bacilli. This is more lasting in effect if a second and
stronger dose is injected some days later.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>By Weakened Virus.</i> This has been secured by heating the
defibrinated blood to 55° C. for ten minutes (Toussaint); Pasteur,
Chamberland and Roux accomplished the same end by making
anthrax cultures at 42° to 43° C. in presence of air; Chauveau by
subjecting the virulent culture for eight days to oxygen under a
pressure of 8 atmospheres at a temperature of 38° C.; Chamberland,
Roux and others have cultivated the bacillus in weak
antiseptic bouillons as phenic acid (1:600 or 1200), bichromate of
potash (1:2000 or 5000), sulphuric acid (2:100).</p>

<p class='c008'>Other methods have been followed, as growing the bacillus in
the blood or serum of immune animals (dog, chicken, pigeon,
white rat, frog).</p>

<p class='c008'>Of these different methods that of Pasteur has been most extensively
adopted. The temperature of culture (42° C.) prevents
the formation of spores and the duration of exposure to air
gradually lessens the virulence until in 12 or 13 days it is not
fatal to the Guinea pig and after 31 days it fails to kill the young
mouse. Thus preparations of varying grades of virulence, and
adapted to the varying susceptibility of different animals, are
secured. The protective inoculation is made by preference in
spring, when there is less chance of complication by a coincident
accidental infection, it is to be avoided if possible in animals at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>hard work, in advanced gestation, in full milk, in extreme youth,
or in ill health. To secure the best results it should be repeated
with a stronger preparation 12 to 15 days after the first injection.
The acquired immunity lasts a year and over, and it is probably
perpetuated by new and non-fatal doses taken in casually, on the
anthrax pastures. Hundreds of thousands of live stock in all
parts of the world have been treated in this way with the result
of reducing a mortality of two, five or ten per cent. to insignificant
proportions. It can only be safely adopted on anthrax lands,
as elsewhere it may lead to the stocking of new areas with a
malignant germ which in young and susceptible animals reacquires
its original virulence.</p>

<p class='c008'>It can never be safely ignored that we are dealing with the
living seed of a most deadly infection. Though robbed of a
large part of its virulence by artificial culture at 107:5° F., yet
many accidental conditions, contribute to a relapse to its original
potency, and when it has once killed a victim, the reacquired
virulence is usually persistent. If the virus employed for protective
purposes in cattle and sheep, is inoculated on Guinea pigs
of 1 to 30 days old, from these on those of several months, and
from these last on sheep, the virulence is constantly and persistently
enhanced. The same is true of the microbe which is inoculated
on a succession of pullets of steadily encreasing ages (Roux
and Chamberland), or on a succession of pigeons (Metchnikoff).
The germs reinforced in potency in any such way
are liable to be the starting points for dangerous infections in
animals and permanent contamination of soils and waters.
Fortunately an occurrence of this kind is rare, yet with a wide
application of the Pasteurian inoculation the opportunities also
are great, and with the free sale and distribution of the mitigated
virus (anthrax “vaccine”), the evil may grow indefinitely. The
method departs from the ideal one, aimed at a final extinction of
the disease, and accepts in place a mere temporary protection of
the herd or flock, and though in this affection eradication cannot
always be secured, every effort should be made to gain it and
above all to prevent an encrease of the area of infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Technique.</i> The weakened virus (1st “vaccin”) is sold in
tubes holding enough for 100, 200, or 300 sheep. Of this
⅛ cc. is injected subcutem on the inner side of the thigh of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>mature sheep, and 12 or 15 days later a similar dose of the stronger
preparation (“2d vaccin”). For the ox or horse double the
amount (¼th cc.) is used, being injected behind the shoulder,
and on the side of the neck in the respective animals. The dose
is graduated in the different subjects according to the size and
age, yet a considerable latitude is permissible. The syringe must
be disinfected before and after inoculations by a 5 per cent. solution
of carbolic acid, or by boiling, and the nozzle should be
dipped in strong carbolic acid immediately before and after each
insertion. This will greatly obviate infection of the liquid used,
and of the wound by any virulent germs lodged on the surface of
the skin. The liquid to be injected should be used as soon as
possible after preparation, and if kept should be in a dark cold
place, and if the tube is once opened the whole of its contents
should be used the same day,—never kept over. The second,
stronger preparation should never be used until the system has
been prepared for it by the use of the first.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>By the Soluble Toxins in Sterile Solution.</i> In 1884, in an outbreak
of anthrax in Skaneateles, N. Y., I drew blood from an
anthrax cow, subjected it to 212° F. for 30 minutes, dissolved out
the soluble toxins in boiled water, and injected the product subcutem,
in the dose of 2 to 4cc. according to size, into every apparently
healthy member of the herd, excepting one, which was left
as a check. The check animal died of anthrax while all of the
others escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since that time I have personally used it in every herd where
opportunity offered, and with equally good results. In an outbreak
near Elmira, Dr. Moore adopted it in a large dairy herd,
and the disease was suddenly arrested.</p>

<p class='c008'>In several experimental cases (one cow and 2 Guinea pigs) at
the N. Y. S. V. College, the outcome was not so satisfactory and
in a herd in Oneida Co., N. Y., it is said to have failed to check
the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding these untoward results in other hands, I am
still confident that we have in this a measure of no small value,
and worthy of application in suitable cases. A certain percentage
of failures in immunization are to be looked for. Even cowpox
vaccination is not always protective against itself; I knew one
man who was successfully vaccinated every three years in a comparatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>long series. Many habitually self-limiting diseases
relapse in particular individuals. Even in the case of anthrax
excess of glucose in the system, and the lack of some unknown
influence of the spleen are respectively destructive of immunity.
Even after the Pasteurian inoculation a certain number of inoculated
animals are lost, it may be between the first and second
injection, or it may be “two or three months” after the latter
(Galtier). We must also bear in mind that in an infected herd
or flock, there are always a certain number already infected at the
time of the protective inoculation, and as the protective conditions
are slowly established, through the action of the leucocytes, it is
unreasonable to expect that serious illness and death can be obviated
in such animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>In inoculation with the Pasteur lymph, the bacillus is held not
to enter the blood, a position supported by the researches of
Bitter, Perroncito, Wissokovicz, Lubarsch, Metchnikoff, Chamberland
and Roux, so that the resulting immunization must come
from the toxins. Add to this that Chauveau (1885), conferred
immunity on a sheep by injecting intravenously, anthrax blood,
defibrinated and sterilized by heat: Arloing obtained immunity
in the sheep by injecting, subcutem, the clear supernatant liquid
from old bouillon cultures of anthrax, from which all bacilli had
been precipitated. Roux and Chamberland obtained the same
result by using the pulp of an anthrax spleen treated with
essential oil of mustard, so as to destroy the life of the bacillus,
and then evaporated in vacuo to remove the essence. Smaller
doses proved effective, than when the splenic pulp had been
filtered or sterilized by heating to 58° C.</p>

<p class='c008'>The advantages of using sterilized toxins are numerous:—</p>

<p class='c008'>1st. As the material can be derived from a case of the outbreak
in hand, there is no risk of using the anthrax protective inoculation
for black quarter, hæmorrhagic septicæmia or other disease
which is so often confounded with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. There is no danger of the sudden enhancing of the potency
of a weakened microbe on account of some condition of the
animal inoculated, as no living microbe is employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d. There is no possibility of planting the anthrax bacillus, on
new soil, as is so liable to take place in using the weakened
microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>4th. There is no necessity for the care and cost of holding the
inoculated animals apart by themselves, under official veterinary
control for 15 days, of withholding their products from market,
or of disinfecting the place where they have been kept. On the
contrary the animals inoculated can be treated in every way as if
no such injection had been made.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Thorough Drainage and Æration of Land.</i> The most thorough
and permanent method of eradicating anthrax is by thorough
æration of the soil. In dry, sandy, or gravelly soils, having a
good natural or artificial drainage, and not underlaid by an impermeable
damp stratum, the bacillus is never permanently found,
and, if introduced, is slowly robbed of its virulence by the action
of the oxygen. When a soil can be well and permanently ærated
by thorough underdrainage, a few years suffice to rob it of its infecting
property and render it salubrious. In many localities,
however, this is actually or economically impossible, so that the
owner is thrown back on the alternatives, of abandoning the soil
for stock, or of immunizing all the animals placed on it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention of Importation of Anthrax.</i> To prevent the introduction
of anthrax into a country or district, the usual control
must be exerted on trade in cattle and their products, as in the
case of other infectious diseases. The exclusion of livestock
from an anthrax-infected country or district, or the admission
after 6 to 10 days of quarantine and the disinfection of the surface
of the animal. Dried hides, horns, hoofs, hair, wool and
bristles are even more dangerous, as they are liable to hold the
microbe in the spore form which will survive indefinitely and
plant the disease widely. The recent great extension of the disease
along the Delaware River, in connection with the morocco
factories, which draw their hides from the most virulently anthrax
regions (India, China, Russia, Africa, S. America) is a strong
case in point, and nearly every tannery planted on a favorable
soil is an example on a smaller scale. Disinfection of all such
products on arrival is essential. But this should be thorough,
and no question of trouble nor expense should stand in the way.
If the trade cannot stand the expense, it has no right to exist
where it is, at the expense of threatened ruin, local and ultimately
general, of agriculture, on which all other industries are based.
Similar control is demanded of live stock products from infected
regions in America.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The control of home markets, stockyards, and abattoirs is no
less important. Fortunately the disease is shortlived and deadly,
and is much more easily discovered and arrested than in the case
of plagues with prolonged incubation and frequently occult form
(glanders, tuberculosis). An inspection of the various markets,
and the detention of herds that have shown anthrax infection
would do much to limit extension. This would entail the disinfection
of the infected places, cars, boats, harness, clothing,
and other things, and of the skins of the healthy animals of the
infected herd.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The Therapeutic Treatment</i> of anthrax in animals must in the
main follow in the same lines given below for the human being;
locally, antiseptics (mercuric chloride or iodide, Luzol’s solution,
hydrochloric acid, phenic acid, iodized phenol, creoline, cresyl,
oil of turpentine, formalin, salicylic acid, scarification, excision
of the primary sore or swelling with antisepsis, antiseptic injections
into the swelling.) Internally, there have been employed,
dilute phenic acid, creolin, terebene, calomel, quinine, hydrochloric
acid, bichromate of potash, tincture of iron chloride, etc.
(see below).</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ANTHRAX IN MAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Causes: infection from animals and their products, from soil, by flies, by
dust. An industrial disease, of workers among animals and animal products.
Wounds as infection atria, ingestion anthrax, inhalation. Lesions: malignant
vesicle, anthrax œdema, intestinal anthrax: pulmonary anthrax.
Symptoms: malignant vesicle, œdematous anthrax, intestinal, pulmonary.
Prevention. Treatment: caustics: antiseptics, excision of nodule and subsidiary
glands, mercurial ointment, iodine, sodium bicarbonate. For intestinal
anthrax: emetic, oleaginous purgatives, potassium iodide, sodium
salicylate, iron muriate, heart stimulants. For pulmonary anthrax: inhale
chlorine, iodine, bromine, phenic acid, eucalyptol, oil of cinnamon, sterilized
cultures of prodigiosus, pneumococcus of Friedländer, bacillus
pyocyaneus, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus: blood serum of
immune animals: blood serum (sterilized) of anthrax cattle.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Causes.</i> Anthrax in man is usually the result of contamination
by infected animals or their products. It is quite possible that
man, like animals, may be infected directly from the soil or water,
or from the same source through the medium of flies or windblown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>dust, yet undoubted cases of this kind are rare or unrecognized.
The animal origin of the disease, as regards man, makes
this largely an industrial affection, attacking shepherds, cattlemen,
horsemen, farmers, drovers, butchers, veterinarians, tanners,
and workers in hides, wool, hair, bristles, furs, hoofs, bones, rags,
felt, glue, and even leather. The sound skin is sufficient protection,
but the slightest abrasion may form an infection atrium.
Workers in tanneries and those who live near them are notoriously
subject to anthrax. The hides must of course be drawn from an
anthrax region. Russian, Armenian, South American, Australian
and African hides have an especially bad reputation. The
<i>British Medical Journal</i>, May 21st, 1898, records cases occurring
in postal clerks who had to handle foreign parcels bound with
strips of hide. Proust records cases from handling Chinese goat
skins (Bull. de l’Acad. de Med. 1894). Infection may also occur
through leather made from infected hides as proved experimentally
on Guinea pigs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hair has long been recognized as a frequent medium of infection
and outbreaks among brushmakers have been recently
recorded by Gerode, Sarmont and Chauveau. (Compt. Rend.
de l’Acad. des Sc. 1893). Trousseau reports twenty cases in
Paris, all contracted from South American horse hair. Wool
from infected countries is often dangerous and has given rise to
special names for the disease (wool-sorter’s, rag-picker’s) which
may be developed in the lungs from inhalation of the dust. In
the same way those who handle bones about fertilizer, glue and
rendering works, are particularly exposed. The agency of insects
in man is undoubted. In sixty cases recorded by Dr. Bell, fifty-four
were on the face, two on the hands, one on the wrist and
one on the forearm. This is mainly due to blood-sucking flies,
yet Heim incriminates the coleoptera as well (Compt. Rend. de
Soc. de Biol. 1894). Wounds of all kinds contribute to inoculation,
hence, the presence of burdocks, thorns, thistles and the
like in the matted wool or hair is often a direct cause of infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The infection may be transferred on surgical instruments, and
in these days of hypodermic medication the greatest care is necessary
to prevent infection through the needle.</p>

<p class='c008'>As in animals man suffers from ingestion and inhalation of the
bacillus; and sometimes widespread mortality comes in this way.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Meat just killed may be thoroughly disinfected by the secretions
of a healthy stomach, yet the bacillus may pass through in an
envelope of fat, in an undigested mass or during an attack of dyspepsia,
and infect the intestines. The spores are proof against the
gastric juice, and as they are produced in a few hours after death
the meat of an anthrax animal must always be considered as exceedingly
dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Man is much less susceptible than some other animals and the
disease wherever inoculated tends to remain for a time localized,
in the skin, the lungs or the bowels. The forms of the disease
are <i>malignant carbuncle</i> (pustule), <i>malignant œdema</i>, <i>intestinal
anthrax</i>, and <i>pulmonary anthrax</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The morbid histology is in the main the same as
described in animals. In the protracted cases there is the same
dark nonærated blood, forming a loose coagulum, the crenated
or distorted blood globules aggregated in irregular masses, the
escape and solution of the hæmoglobin so as to stain the white
tissues, the enlargement of the spleen which is gorged with dark
blood, and the hyperæmia of the liver and lymph glands. There
is in the affected tissues and usually in the blood the characteristic
large bacillus anthracis.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>malignant vesicle</i> there is first a minute, firm central,
dark nodule like an insect bite with a lighter colored areola, and
showing not only hyperæmia, but blocking of the capillaries, and
minute areas of extravasation. Somewhat later the dark centre
is surmounted by a small vesicle, beneath which the tissues are
becoming necrotic, and the area of congestion and extravasation
has extended and thus the local disease advances by a constant
invasion of new tissue which in its turn becomes the seat of coagulation
necrosis. On microscopic section the central necrotic part
shows the cells of the rete Malpighi separated by a finely granular
coagulum, and the papillæ are greatly swollen by serous and
hæmorrhagic exudate. The cell nuclei are necrotic and no
longer take a stain. The capillaries are gorged with red globules
and bacilli. In the surrounding tissues there is much congestion
and exudation, with numerous points of extravasation, but the
abundant multinuclear cells retain their staining power.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>Anthrax Œdema</i>, which appears in parts like the eyelids,
neck and forearm where there is an abundance of loose connective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>tissue and a scanty blood supply, there is no firm central nodule,
but a diffuse soft infiltration, with points or patches of a yellow
or reddish color. The capillaries are congested, with minute
emboli and extravasations and there is an excessive and rapidly
spreading exudation. It shows a great tendency to early general
infection and may end in vesication and local gangrene or in
favorable cases in resolution.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>Intestinal anthrax</i> (intestinal mycosis) the lesions are
usually concentrated on the small intestines, while the stomach
and large intestines in the main escape. The walls of the bowel
are of a dark red, and greatly thickened by exudation and
extravasation which also mixes with the ingesta giving it a dark
bloody tinge. At intervals on the mucosa are nodular hæmorrhagic
swellings, from the size of a linseed to a pea, with commencing
necrotic changes or the formation of sores. The mesenteric
glands are swollen, infiltrated and hæmorrhagic, and like
the other lesions abound in bacilli. Hyperæmia and engorgement
of the liver and above all of the spleen are the rule.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>pulmonary anthrax</i> (wool-sorter’s disease) a sanguineous
liquid is found in the lower trachea and bronchia, and not infrequently
in the pleuræ and pericardium. The bronchial glands
are swollen, hyperæmic and often hæmorrhagic, and exudations
and extravasations may be found in the mediastinum and lungs.
Lesions of the intestines and spleen are common, and in all alike
the bacilli are found.</p>

<p class='c008'>In certain cases the anthrax lesions may be found in the brain,
or any part of the body but in all they show the same general
characters and the same specific microbe.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SYMPTOMS: DIAGNOSIS.</h3>

<p class='c015'><i>Malignant Vesicle</i> (<i>pustule</i>). Symptoms may vary somewhat
but are in the main as follows: An itching papule appears in the
seat of inoculation, which might be mistaken for an insect bite
but for the dark red color of the centre. Occurring on an uncovered
portion of the skin, in an anthrax district, or near a
factory where anthrax products are likely to be used, this should
at once create suspicion. Soon the dark centre is covered by a
small vesicle with clear contents which later become bloody.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Within 24 or 48 hours the vesicle dries up, becoming firm,
resistant and brownish red or blackish gray, and apparently gangrenous.
The swelling has meanwhile extended to ½ or ¾ inch
in diameter and a row of fresh vesicles may appear which in their
turn give place to a necrotic slough. In this way extension may
take place, the sore retaining a more or less rounded form, and
necrosis extending from the centre in every direction. The
necrotic mass, however, remains firmly adherent to the adjacent
tissues until separated by the work of suppuration which ensues
in favorable cases. The disease is attended with more or less
fever, chill, hyperthermia, nausea, diarrhœa, with aching of
head, back, and limbs and unfavorable cases may merge into
acute and fatal general anthrax. The mortality is about 20 per
cent., though in special epidemics it has reached 80 per cent.
(With the pustule on the face 25 per cent.; on the lower limb 5
per cent., Norris). The prognosis is favorable with a free concentration
of leucocytes, a moist condition of the wound and
above all a liberal invasion of pus cocci. It is unfavorable when
the wound is dry, when the drying slough remains firmly
adherent and when the adjacent lymph glands become implicated.
In non-fatal cases it may be difficult to find the bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Anthrax Œdema.</i> This is less easily diagnosed than malignant
vesicle, and appears where the connective tissue is loose,
abundant and little vascular, from direct local inoculation, or as
a concomitant of internal anthrax. It is a flat, rapidly extending
swelling, with the skin comparatively unaltered, though at points
yellowish or reddish discoloration indicates congestion and extravasation.
Not being limited by firm tissues nor aggregations
of accumulating leucocytes it tends to a speedy general infection
with all the febrile manifestations of that condition. Thus chills,
nausea, hyperthermia, dusky reddish or brownish mucosæ,
cephalalgia, rachialgia and profound prostration assist in diagnosis.
The bacilli in the blood and exudate would serve to confirm
the conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Intestinal Anthrax.</i> Here again the ingestion of anthrax
products, and the simultaneous attack of a number of people
who have taken such materials will often assist in diagnosis.
There may have been for some days indications of local bowel
lesions, such as chilliness, elevation of temperature, nausea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>headache, and giddiness. Suddenly these become more violent,
there is vomiting and sanguineous diarrhœa, extreme anxiety and
debility, cyanosis, dyspnœa, and it may be the appearance of
petechiæ on the skin and mucosæ or even of local swellings. In
some cases there are convulsions or other symptoms of nervous
disorder and in others extreme prostration and collapse. The
bacillus is not always to be found in the circulating blood, but
may be detected in sanguineous excretions, or by cultures.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pulmonary Anthrax.</i> (Woolsorter’s disease). Here again
the occupation of the patient assists in diagnosis. For two to
five days prodromata similar to those of intestinal anthrax may
be noted. The difficulty in breathing, dyspnœa, cough, cyanosis
and sense of constriction of the chest are especially diagnostic.
Suddenly all these symptoms are aggravated, respirations become
30 to 40 per minute, the pulse 120 to 150, the temperature 104°
to 106°, and there is a frothy bloody expectoration in which the
bacilli may be detached. There may be indications of intestinal,
cerebral or nephritic lesions, and bloody discharges. Death
usually occurs in 12 to 48 hours from collapse, or coma, from
asphyxia or in convulsions. The few recoveries are tardy and
tremors and spasms persist for a length of time. In the most
favorable cases the disease does not proceed beyond the initial
stage.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Prevention is the most important consideration and this will
include all that has been stated above with regard to the restriction
of the disease in flocks and herds, the drainage and improvement
of anthrax lands, the seclusion, destruction, deep burial or
cremation of carcasses without autopsy or incision, the disinfection
of stalls, secretions and all contaminated products, and the
suppression of all traffic in anthrax products—meat, milk, blood,
guts, bones, horns, hoofs, hair, wool, bristles, etc., or the
thorough disinfection of the same. Above all, is the adoption of
personal precautions. No one should handle anthrax animals,
nor suspected products who has any sore or abrasion on hands or
face, or such sore may be temporarily covered with a film of albuminate
of silver, or the hands may be washed with a solution
of mercuric chloride (1:500), or chloride of lime (1:200). If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>persons must work in wool or textile products which are open to
suspicion a respirator is an obvious precaution, and this may be
disinfected by live steam at intervals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment of malignant pustule</i> is mainly surgical. At the
outset the thorough destruction of the dark central point or nodule
with a red hot needle or powerful caustic will be sufficient.
Even when the pustule is fully formed, its free excision with as
much of the surrounding infiltrated tissue as can be safely accomplished
and the free application of caustics will usually succeed.
Potassa fusa, or zinc chloride (1:3), or mercuric chloride
or iodide in powder with or without calomel, or pyoktanin, or
formaline, or iodized phenol may be named as especially applicable.
Injections of carbolic acid (5 or 10:100) into the indurated
centre and infiltrated periphery have proved very successful. In
the case of Kaloff, when the excision of the nodule followed by
the local use of carbolic acid solution, failed to prevent implication
of the inguinal and pectoral glands, violent fever, prostration,
and diarrhœa; the excision of the affected glands and the
free use of phenic acid solution (5:100) in the adjacent tissues
led to speedy improvement. Some surgeons make a crucial incision
of the pustule and apply caustics freely. Muskett has been
successful in excising the nodule, filling the wound with ipecacuan
powder and giving the same agent internally. Many mild cases,
or those that occur in refractory systems will however recover
spontaneously or under a less drastic treatment. In the anthrax
districts of Russia mercurial ointment is rubbed on the sore, and
the application of tincture of iodine or iodized phenol to the raw
sore or incised nodule and surrounding infiltration is often successful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Camescasse has claimed great success by incising the swelling,
applying tincture of iodine freely, and then wrapping in cloths
kept wet with a solution of 5 drachms of bicarbonate of soda in a
quart of tepid water.</p>

<p class='c008'>When systemic reaction has set in it is desirable to have resort
to general medication as for internal anthrax.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment of Anthrax Œdema</i> must follow the same rule.
Free incisions into the œdematous tissues with the application of
antiseptics, solution of mercuric chloride or biniodide (1:1000), or
the injection of the whole infiltrated area and around it with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>same agents, with phenic acid (5 or 10:100), or with pyoktanin
(1:1000) will prove useful, and as in the malignant pustule the
surface should be kept disinfected by a compress wet in solution
of the mercuric chloride or biniodide, carbolic acid, iodized phenol,
formalin or pyoktanin. If the pain of these applications is
very acute cocaine will be demanded or even ether. If ether is applied
to the surface its evaporation will cool the parts and retard
the proliferation of the bacillus. Under other conditions cold
water, pounded ice or snow may be applied.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment of Intestinal Anthrax.</i> When anthrax flesh has
been eaten, or when there are symptoms of incipient intestinal
anthrax, the first resort is an emetic of ipecacuan, followed by an
active oleaginous purgative to clear the <i>prima viæ</i> of bacilli and
their toxins. To these may be added potassium iodide, pyoktanin,
sodium salicylate, quinine or tincture of muriate of iron, by
way of keeping in check the multiplication of bacilli. To counteract
depression and heart failure digitalis, strophanthus or
strychnia with alcoholic stimulants may be resorted to.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>Pulmonary Anthrax</i> the same principles are applicable.
The patient may be made to cautiously inhale gaseous chlorine,
iodine or bromine or a solution of iodide of potassium in an atomized
condition. The vapor of carbolic acid, eucalyptol, or oil of
cinnamon may be tried.</p>

<p class='c008'>The irritable stomach may be soothed by oxide of bismuth,
with milk, beef tea and other bland nutritive or stimulating
draughts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The grave character of internal anthrax, however, is such that
resort may be had to one of the various antitoxins, antidotal
cultures, serums, and immunizing agents that have proved useful
in different hands. Unfortunately such agents do not seem to act
in the same manner on all genera, and what has been effective in
one of the lower animals may fail in the human being. Thus
Roger found that sterilized cultures of bacillus prodigiosus retarded
or obviated anthrax in rabbits, but hastened its progress
in the Guinea pig.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sterilized cultures of the pneumococcus of Friedländer (Buchner)
of the bacillus pyocyaneus, or of the staphylococcus pyogems
aureus, (Pawlowsky) when injected subcutem have proved antidotal
to anthrax. Emmerich has successfully used erysipelas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>serum subcutem in the treatment of anthrax. (Münch. Med.
Woch. 1894). The sterilized cultures of the streptococcus
erysipelatos therefore offer themselves as promising curative
agents. The same is true of the sterilized cultures of the bacillus
pyocyaneus (Woodhead and Cartwright-Wood).</p>

<p class='c008'>The blood serum of animals that are naturally immune (frog,
white rat, pigeon, dog,) is bactericidal and to a certain extent
antidotal to the bacillus anthracis, but that of an animal which
is naturally susceptible but which has been artificially immunized
has proved much more potent. In the experience of the writer
this potency attaches no less to the blood of an animal in the advanced
stages of the disease. In adult cattle he has found the
symptoms of anthrax subside under two successive daily doses
(4cc.) subcutem of the sterilized blood serum of one of the
herd which had just died. Relapses were observed several days
after the serum treatment was abandoned. In experiments on
rabbits two check animals with anthrax inoculations died at the
end of 3½ and 4 days. Of six inoculated with anthrax and injected
from one to three times with sterilized (anthrax) blood
serum one recovered, and the others died, one at the end of the
7th, two of the 6th and two of the 5th day. In this connection
it may be stated that successful treatment by leucocytes is claimed,
(Pawlowsky) and that one of the effects of serum treatment is
the destruction in part of the globules and the release of nuclei,
and in this we may have an explanation in part at least of the
therapeutic action of the serum from the infecting and immunized
animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Protective serums may be utilized by hypodermic injections
daily or every second day for a week, giving time for the disposal
of the bacilli present in the system. In the intestinal anthrax
they may be given by the mouth and injected into the
peritoneal cavity. In pulmonary anthrax they may be introduced
into the trachea, bronchi and pleural cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Malleus, Equinia, Farcy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An acute infectious disease caused by the bacillus
mallei, which tends to localize itself in the lymphatic glands and
plexuses, especially of the nose and upper air passages but also
in other parts of the body, where it produces a progressive hyperplasia,
with a strong tendency to degeneration, necrosis, and
liquefaction. It occurs casually in horses, asses, mules and other
solipeds, and is communicable to man and all domestic animals
except the bovine races, chickens, and, under ordinary circumstances,
swine.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> Glanders (Malis) appears to have
prevailed in asses in Greece as noted by Aristotle. Its contagious
prevalence in horses is recorded by Absyrtus in the time of Constantine,
and again by Vegetius Renatus in 381 A.D. At the
present time its existence is almost coextensive with the equine
family, but its prevalence is in a direct ratio with the facilities for
the infection of fresh subjects. In the central countries of
Europe where the equine population is greatest and where there
is the most extensive trade and movement among horses it secures
the greatest relative number of victims. War with its constant
opportunities for infection, in crowded cavalry and artillery
stables and the successive changing of place, tends greatly to enhance
its ravages. Thus in the German army it rose from 966 to
2058 per 100,000 per annum in the year of the Franco-German
war; in Spain it was practically unknown until the Napoleonic
war in the Peninsula, but after this it proved a veritable scourge;
in Hindostan it was hardly known until the Sepoy rebellion yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>its ravages greatly hampered the army movement in Afghanistan
in 1879; and in the United States it became very prevalent in the
armies during the Civil War of 1861–4, and was widely scattered
over the whole country on the sale of the army horses and mules.
Since that time, as before, it has been most prevalent in the car
stables of the great cities, though it has also gained a wide extension
in many great horsebreeding establishments in the Rocky
Mountain region, where however it proves much less destructive
than in the East.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is unknown in Australia, whence it is excluded by a rigid
system of quarantine.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Susceptibility of Different Animals.</i> Horses, asses and mules
are the most susceptible, and it is only exceptionally that the
disease is contracted casually outside the class of solipeds. The
Guinea pig and rabbit are susceptible to glanders in the order
named and the former is especially available for experimental
diagnostic inoculations. The goat, cat and dog sometimes contract
the disease from living in stables with glandered horses, but
infection is much more certain when they are inoculated. The
pigeon is also susceptible. In the dog the disease is rarely fatal,
but the ulcerations tend to heal in 14 days and recovery ensues.
In sheep and goats too, many cases recover though in other cases
an internal infection takes place followed by death. Swine are
comparatively insusceptible, but they may be successfully inoculated
when in ill health and low condition. (Spinola, Cadeac and
Malet). Cattle and chickens have uniformly proved refractory
even on inoculation. White and house mice and rats, have proved
immune, also linnets and chaffinches and the frog at ordinary
temperature. If however the frog is placed in water at 30° C.,
he may be successfully inoculated and, though it does not prove
fatal, the bacillus may be found in the blood and tissues after a
lapse of 50 days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Etiology.</i> As already stated this disease is due to the presence
of a microörganism, the <i>bacillus mallei</i>. Many secondary causes,
however, contribute to its propagation. The activity of movement
and commingling of horses has been already noticed.
Crowding in close yards where the animals bite each other, snort
out the virulent discharges on each other and eat and drink from
the same troughs, leads to a rapid extension. Even on the western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>ranges where the disease tends to be mild, Billings observed
a deadly extension when yarded during winter storms. Debility
from chronic ill health, starvation, overwork and damp, dark,
draughty stables, is so conducive to the disease that it was at one
time considered as the sole cause. Close confinement in impure
air is at once a cause of increased susceptibility and a means of
concentration and transmission of the poison. Hence confinement,
between decks, of military and other horses, carried by sea,
is a source of wide extensions. On the other hand insular places
from which strange horses are excluded or into which they are
admitted under careful inspection and quarantine have succeeded
in preserving immunity. Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand
are examples.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacillus Mallei.</i> Christot and Kiener claimed to have found a
bacillus in the lesions of glanders in 1868. In 1881 bacilli were
found by Bouchard in a glander abscess in man, and these were
cultivated <i>in vitro</i> and inoculated in a number of animals, by
Capitan and Charrin in 1882. Independently in the same year
(1882) Löffler and Schütz discovered the bacillus, cultivated it
<i>in vitro</i>, and successfully inoculated it on animals. The microbe
is rod-shaped, 2 to 5μ long, by 0.5 to 1.4μ thick, the same length
as the bacillus tuberculosis but thicker. It is nonmotile, ærobic
(facultative anærobic) and grows readily in a variety of culture
media at a temperature of 37° C. On neutral bouillon of the
flesh of horse, ox, calf or chicken with or without peptone, it
grows readily, producing cloudiness in one or two days. In peptonized
gelatine it forms a whitish flocculent mass. On glycerine
agar with milk it forms in 48 hours a milk white layer, changing
to yellowish brown. On potato it forms long slender filaments,
in yellow, viscous, glistening colonies, changing to fawn and
darker. It grows best at 35° to 39° C. and growth ceases below
25° C., and above 42° C. It stains tardily in aniline colors, and
not at all by Gram’s or Weigert’s, but will readily take Kuhne’s
stain prepared as follows: take of phenic acid in solution (5:100)
50cc., absolute alcohol 10cc., and 1 to 2 grammes methylin blue.
The stain is very easily bleached by acid, differing in this from
the bacillus tuberculosis. For decolorizing Löffler recommends
10cc. distilled water, 2 drops of strong sulphuric acid, and 1
drop of a 5 per cent. solution of oxalic acid. Sections should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>left in this not longer than 5 seconds. The bacillus often appears
granular, and unequally stained in its different parts. It may be
difficult of discovery in old standing lesions of horses, but comes
out clearly in recent lesions of experimental cases in Guinea pigs
and donkeys.</p>

<p class='c008'>Baumgarten claims sporulation but this is uncertain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacillus has only limited power of resistance to destructive
physical and chemical agents. It is killed in 10 minutes at 55° C.,
in 2 minutes at 100° C., or by mercuric chloride solution (1:5000),
or by phenol (5:100), or by permanganate of potass (1:100). In
warm dry air and sunshine it is sterilized, in thick layers in 2
months (Peuch), in moderate layers in 4 to 15 days (Galtier),
and in very thin layers in 3 days (Cadeac and Malet). In moist,
cool air and in the shade it is much more resistant. In stables it
may remain virulent for three or four months, and thus the disease
has often reappeared among the newly introduced horses
after a stable has been abandoned for a length of time. The
microbe does not grow in infusions of hay, straw or horse manure,
and it is doubtful if it can maintain an active saprophytic existence.
Its vitality and virulence, however, persists in putrefying
materials for 14 to 24 days, and in water from 15 to 20 days.
Hence it is largely propagated through drinking troughs and occasionally
through ponds, lakes and sluggish streams. Again the
virus is likely to be preserved in and transmitted by rotten or even
sound woodwork, as of mangers, racks, buckets, shafts and poles,
and by harness, halters, blankets, combs, brushes and rubbers.
Sometimes direct transmission takes place in snorting or coughing,
or by the animals biting or licking each other. As the virus
is spattered on surrounding objects, the walls, stable utensils,
soiled fodder and feed, and even the attendant’s clothes may be
the medium of transmission. Contagion during copulation is
not unknown, nor infection of the fœtus <i>in utero</i> from a diseased
mother. Carnivora (dog, cat, lion) fed on the diseased carcasses
have become infected. Experimentally infection has been conveyed
by administering, by the mouth, balls containing the virus
(Renault, Coleman, etc.), and again by transfusing the blood
from a bad case of glanders into the veins of a sound horse
(Viborg, Coleman, Renault, Hering, Chauveau, Nocard). Transmission
through the air on dust is counteracted by the speedy destruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>of virulence on dust, and horses often stand side by side
in adjacent stalls for months without communicating the infection.
Such escapes may, however, in some of these cases, be attributed
to the immunity secured by a previous exposure and slight attack.
That the germs may be exceptionally conveyed through the air
appears to have been proved by Viborg and Gerlach, who collected
the floating dust in a stable containing infected animals and
successfully inoculated with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The microbes are especially found in the visible lesions of
glanders, in the mucous, cutaneous and subcutaneous swellings
and abscesses, in the swollen lymph glands, in the nodules and
ulcers of the mucous membranes and skin, in the morbid
discharges, from the nose, eyes, pharynx, guttural pouches,
larynx, trachea and bronchia, and in the discharge of farcy buds
and abscesses. They are not necessarily distributed through all
the tissues, and in chronic cases, with strictly local lesions, the infection
appears to be often confined to these or nearly so, and the
contamination of other animals is slow and uncertain. When,
however, the disease is acute and advanced, or generalized, every
part must be looked upon as probably infecting. Thus virulence
has been shown in the blood, the exhalations of the serous membranes,
saliva, the aqueous humor (Cadeac and Malet), the tears,
(Viborg), the muscles, and the bones. Galtier says the milk,
sperm, bile and intestinal mucous are non-virulent, also the vaccine
lymph raised on glandered animals, but much must depend
on the grade and stage of the disease and no one would care to
run unnecessary risks with these liquids.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Infection Atria.</i> Inoculation on a skin wound or abrasion, is
a most effective mode of transmission, but the virus undoubtedly
enters in certain cases with the air, food or water, or by accidental
lodgment of a speck of the virus on the mucosa of the
nose or eye or other natural opening. Through the healthy mucosa
the bacillus may enter by penetrating the soft epithelium, or
entering the mucous follicles, but it will find the way smoothed
for it, if there has been friction, abrasion, desquamation or congestion.
The skin in its healthy state is usually resistant, but
Babes has conveyed infection by rubbing on the virus mixed
with vaseline, and without displacing the epithelium. The channel
of entrance was the hair follicles. Injected into the blood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>intravenously, or into a serous cavity, the bacillus infects with
great certainty and promptitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is ample evidence that primary lesions appear not only
in the skin and nasal mucosa, but also in the bronchia, intestines,
and other parts. Much time and ink have been wasted in attempts
to prove that pulmonary lesions are always secondary, and
doubtless many are so, but the cases in which the lesions are confined
to the bronchia or parenchyma, and the many parallel cases
of direct infection of the lungs by other diseases (tuberculosis,
lung plague, contagious pneumonia, influenza, etc.,) furnish conclusive
enough evidence that the germ may be inhaled and
colonize this part first. Cases of inhalation bronchitis, are
equally corroborative, and not only may the grosser solids be
aspired, but infection droplets can easily gravitate down when
from congestion or inflammation the action of the tracheal and
bronchial cilia, is suspended.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FORMS AND LESIONS OF GLANDERS IN SOLIPEDS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Glanders appears in two primary forms—<i>acute</i> and <i>chronic</i>, and
each of these is further divided according as the lesions are exclusively
or mainly seated in one part of the body or another.
The generic term <i>glanders</i> is habitually used to designate that
form in which the lesions are situated in the nose, the nasal
sinuses, and the submaxillary lymphatic glands—<i>nasal glanders</i>.
When the principle lesions are situated in the lungs and lymph
glands of the chest, the case is one of <i>pulmonary glanders</i>.
When the skin and subcutaneous lymphatics are most prominently
affected it is known as <i>farcy</i> or <i>cutaneous glanders</i>. When the skin
and nose are simultaneously affected the name <i>farcy glanders</i> is
sometimes applied. But as the bacillus may enter by very varied
channels the primary lesions may appear in still other organs.
Thus in stallions the first symptom is often a glanderous orchitis.
In other horses it may be a glanderous arthritis, and in still others
infected by ingestion it may be an abdominal infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of Nasal Glanders in Solipeds.</i> <i>Acute.</i> After an
incubation of three to five days the subject shows prostration,
weariness, stiffness, erection of the hair, and even tremor or
shivering, inappetence, thirst, hyperthermia, rapid pulse, weeping
eyes, the discharge becoming purulent, snuffling breathing, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>discharge from the nose, at first serous, with a remarkable viscidity
which tends to glue together the long hairs or even the
margins of the nostrils. This discharge may be reddish, greenish,
or brownish and may become distinctly purulent and opaque.
The <i>alæ nasi</i> are swollen, hot and painful, and the mucosa red,
congested, thickened, with a blackish or violet tint especially along
the median part of the <i>septum nasi</i>. On these, violet patches
appear on the second or third day, pronounced elevations of very
varying size indicating the centres of active hyperplasia. They
are usually yellowish or grayish, surrounded by a deep violet
areola, and may become confluent forming patches. The centre
of each undergoes rapid degeneration, forming a rounded ulcer
with salient edges, a yellowish base, more or less pointed or
streaked with red, and a viscid seropurulent or bloody discharge
which may concrete in crusts or scale. The whole septum may
become one continuous ulcer with excavations of various depths
surrounded by hyperplastic elevations, and involving not only
the mucosa, but even the cartilage and leading to perforations.</p>

<p class='c008'>From an early stage of the attack the submaxillary lymphatic
glands and the investing connective tissue become swollen, forming
a mass of firm bean- or pea-like nodules, with no excessive
heat nor tenderness, and with little disposition to suppurate and
discharge. If this has lasted for some time the glands often become
more firmly attached to adjacent parts (maxilla, tongue)
by the contraction of the exudate.</p>

<p class='c008'>The swelling of the alæ nasi also often extends to the skin of the
face, and firm, rounded cords formed by the swollen lymphatics
stretch upward toward the eye, or the submaxillary glands.
Upon the turgid lymphatics may appear more or less rounded
nodules from the size of peas to hazel nuts, which, unlike the
submaxillary glands, tend to soften, burst and discharge a viscid,
glairy, sanious liquid.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same time the morbid process is liable to show itself in
the cutaneous lymphatics of one limb, usually a hind one, in the
form of firm cords, with degenerating or ulcerous nodules (farcy
buds) and pasty patches. Or the throat or lungs may become
involved, with local swellings, violent cough, dyspnœa and fever.
The swellings of the cutaneous lymphatics usually follow the
course of the veins, in the hind limbs the branches of the saphena,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>and extend from below upward, and the first nodules may be on
the fetlock or hock.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of Chronic Nasal Glanders in Solipeds.</i> The chronic
form of the disease follows an indolent course, and local symptoms
are often so slight or equivocal that the true nature of the
malady is unsuspected. If the patient is well fed and cared for
and not overworked, the malady may run a course of three, five
or seven years, and the victim may pass through many hands
leaving infection in every stable it occupies. Diagnostic symptoms,
more or less clear, may be obtained from the discharge;
the lesions of the mucosa and the submaxillary glands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>nasal discharge</i> may be bilateral, but if confined to one
nostril is strongly suggestive of glanders. It may be profuse or
scanty, continuous or intermittent, of a yellowish, purulent tint,
or greenish, or grayish and with a special tendency to viscidity.
In some indolent cases the nostrils may be clean but if there is
any matting of the long hairs, or adhesion of the alæ nasi, the
case is specially suspicious. If it is sanious, flocculent, or bloody
it is all the more characteristic, and suggests the supervention of
an acute attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>lesions of the pituitary membrane</i> are varied. Hyperæmia
of a purple or violet color is common, especially along the septum,
and the mucosa is liable to be somewhat tumid or œdematous.
Nodules the size of a pin’s head, a pea or larger appear inside
the inner ala, or on the septum or turbinated bones, and at first
red from extravasation and, as it were vesicular, become grayish,
whitish or yellow with points of red and surrounded by a deeply
congested areola. Larger nodules forming in the submucosa approach
the surface and stand out the size of the tip of the finger
and with the same general character as the smaller. Sooner or
later these degenerate and form ulcers which bear a resemblance
to those of acute glanders but are less angry, and when small and
solitary may be taken for simple erosions. In other cases they
become thickened and indurated with sharply defined projecting
margins, and a yellowish base with points or lines of red. The
presence of red, black, green, or brown crusts may also be noted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another lesion frequently observed in indolent cases is a cicatricial
white spot or patch in which the hyperplasia has become
partially developed into tissue and shows no tendency to ulcerate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>The mucosa may even be drawn or puckered around the cicatrix,
making the illusion all the more complete.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>submaxillary swelling</i> is even less sensitive than in acute
glanders and produces the same sensation as of an aggregation of
small, hard, pea-like, masses with no tendency to ulcerate.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of Cutaneous Glanders (Farcy) in Solipeds.</i> Acute
cutaneous glanders has been already referred to under nasal
glanders. The chronic type is often less characteristic, yet may
be detected by careful observation of the symptoms. The main
symptom may be the swelling of a joint with more or less engorgement
of the limb from attendant lymphangitis. There
can usually be detected around the margins of such swellings firm,
tender cords representing the larger lymphatic vessels and often
branching in their course. In the absence of the engorgement, or
when it is slight, these <i>cords</i> may be the main evidence of the
disorder, and in the hind limb usually follow the course of the
flexor tendons on the inner side of the digit, metacarpus and
thigh. At intervals along the line of the <i>cords</i> appear nodular
masses (farcy buds) varying in size from a pea to a hen’s egg,
and showing a great disposition to soften and discharge a glairy,
sanious or more or less bloody liquid. The inner sides of the
fetlock and tarsus are favorite seats of these nodules but they
may form at any point. On the trunk also the corded lymphatics
and nodules follow the lines of the veins and lymphatics, and
here there may be the complication of large intermuscular
abscesses often in connection with the groups of lymphatic
glands.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Latent or occult glanders</i> is often met with, the indolent, specific
lesions being confined to some internal organs, like the larynx,
lungs or womb, or to the testicles, the nasal diagnostic symptoms
being absent. A chronic cough, with a slight purulent discharge
from the nose, a chronic leucorrhœa, a swollen testicle, or simply
a persistent low condition or weakness without apparent cause,
may be the only indications, and special means of diagnosis are
demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Special Means of Diagnosis.</i> In occult cases, the disease may
be identified by inoculation, or by the mallein test.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Inoculation</i> is best performed on a very susceptible animal. If
the suspected discharge from the nose, vagina, open sore or preferably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>from a freshly incised nodule is inoculated subcutem in
the flank of a male Guinea pig, or better in the peritoneum, there
develops a local ulcerous sore and on the second or third day a
violent orchitis in which pure cultures of the bacillus can be obtained.
The caseous and purulent centres are found not only in
the testicle but along the line of the spermatic cord, affecting the
tunica vaginalis and connective tissue. Death usually follows in
four to fifteen days. The cat and dog can also be utilized, inoculation
being made on the forehead. Old wornout, but otherwise
healthy asses, and even horses make very available subjects, inoculation
in the nose speedily developing acute glanders. In
the absence of a good subject the suspected animal is sometimes
availed of, scarifications being made in the nose and the morbid
product rubbed in freely. The rapid development of ulcerous
wounds is characteristic. If, however, the case is chronic, and if
a fair measure of immunity has been acquired this test may prove
misleading.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Test by Mallein.</i> Mallein is the sterilized and concentrated
toxic product obtained from a pure culture of bacillus mallei in a
peptonized glycerine bouillon. When injected hypodermically in
a small physiological dose this has no effect on a sound horse, but
in one affected with glanders it develops in several hours an extended
swelling in the seat of inoculation, hot, tense and painful,
which continues to enlarge for 24 to 36 hours and does not subside
for 4 or 5 days. From the margin of the swelling, swollen
lymphatics may often be traced running toward the adjacent
lymphatic glands. There is also decided dulness, prostration, inappetence,
staring coat and tremors. The body temperature rises
1.5° to 2.5° and upward from the eighth hour after inoculation
attaining its maximum from the tenth to the eighteenth hour and
subsiding slowly to the forty-eighth to the sixtieth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mallein must be used under precautions like tuberculin. It
must be obtained freshly prepared from a reputable maker. If
preserved for months its force may be largely lost. The animal
to be tested should be in his customary environment, and not just
arrived from a railroad journey nor other cause of excitement. He
must not be fevered as any rise of temperature is then equivocal,
and a fall of temperature, which sometimes occurs in the febrile
system under mallein, is no sure evidence of glanders. Reaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>sometimes fails in advanced cases of glanders, but in such a case
other symptoms are usually diagnostic so that mallein is superfluous
and should not be misleading. The greatest care should be
taken to prevent infection from the syringe, nozzle, skin, hands,
etc., as other infections may give rise to local swelling and hyperthermia
(see tuberculin test). If a first test leaves the matter in
doubt, the animal should be secluded and tested again in a month
(some prefer 3 months).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathological Anatomy.</i> The colonization of the bacillus mallei
in a tissue usually determines a concentration and multiplication
of leucocytes, so as to form rounded nests of small lymphoid cells
in a scanty fibrous network. These may be miliary or by aggregation
they form masses the size of a pea or larger, which bear a
close resemblance to the neoplasms of tuberculosis. As in tubercle
the central cells of the group, degenerate, forming a granular
fatty debris, and constituting an ulcer or abscess. In certain
cases with a proliferation of fibrous tissue a cicatricial material is
developed. Another characteristic lesion is the occurrence of
hyperplasia in the walls of the lymph vessels so as to constitute
firm tender cords, and the infiltration of the adjacent lymphatic
plexus.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>nasal mucosa</i> the bacilli form prolific colonies at different
points of the membrane and submucosa with the active production
of lymphoid cells, followed by granular fatty degeneration and
ulceration. Hence may be found different lesions representing
the different stages. First there may be miliary deposits with
clear contents and standing out like grains of sand. Then there
are the larger pea-like nodules with congested vessels and minute
hæmorrhages, but made up largely of the nests of lymphoid cells.
These may bear on the surface a distinct blood extravasation, or
the epithelium may be raised from the corium layer by a liquid
exudation. The more advanced nodules show the centre light
colored, grayish or yellowish with a distinct granular degeneration
of the cells. Later still the degeneration involves the superficial
layers and epithelium and an open ulcer is formed with a
strong tendency to extend in depth and width. The formation
and degeneration of numerous foci of cell proliferation gives the
ulcer a very uneven outline. The continuous growth of fresh
centres of proliferation may cause marked elevations between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>ulcers, constituting extended patches, or the entire nasal mucosa
may be thickened as the result of the morbid deposit. The cicatrices
resulting from the apparent healing of deep or extensive
ulcers or from a fibroid, transformation of the neoplasm consist of
condensed connective tissue with small scattered nests of lymphoid
cells and bacilli. In chronic cases the bacilli are very scanty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mucosa of the <i>Eustachian pouches and tubes, the larynx,
trachea and bronchia</i> often present lesions similar to those of the
pituitary membrane.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>lungs</i> are usually marked in chronic cases by circumscribed
lobular pneumonia, interlobular and peribronchial inflammations
and miliary or larger areas of degeneration resembling tubercles.
These may begin as a minute congestion and ecchymosis, which
later shows in the centre a translucent or gray mass of lymphoid
cells, with a surrounding area of congestion. Later still this
central mass becomes yellowish and caseated from granular and
fatty degeneration and this gradually extends so as to involve the
whole area of the nodule. The peripheral portion may condense
into a fibroid envelope, but usually this is less smooth and evenly
rounded than in the case of an inspissated abscess or bladder-worm.
The bacilli are found in the affected tissue but not always
abundantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>cutaneous glanders</i> the lesions may begin in the papillary
layer by active congestion and infiltration and proliferation of
lymphoid cells which cause an eruption of rounded papules like
small peas that degenerate and soften and form superficial ulcers.
When the derma is mainly involved the inflamed area becomes
the seat of larger hard nodules which are at first deeply congested,
with capillary thrombi, minute extravasations and rapid cell proliferation;
later on section they show numerous caseated centres
with a dense fibroid framework and surrounded by an area of
active congestion and capillary hæmorrhage; later still the caseation
and softening has caused rupture of the investing epithelium
and the discharge from the ulcerous cavity of a yellowish, glairy,
grumous liquid (open farcy buds). Sometimes the nodule
undergoes fibroid induration and fails to ulcerate, becoming the
counterpart of the cicatrices in the nose. When the infective inflammation
extends to the subcutaneous connective tissue, diffuse
engorgements and extensive swellings occur from the general
infiltration of the abundant lymph plexuses. Lymphoid cells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>accumulate in the perivascular sheaths and lymph plexuses, the
walls of the lymphatic trunks running out of these swellings
become swollen and indurated and at intervals, mostly on the
seat of the valves there is the proliferation of small round cells
to form farcy buds. In chronic cases the fibroid thickening involves
the skin, subcutaneous connective tissue and walls of the
lymph vessels binding the whole into one dense resistant mass,
more or less studded with corded lymphatics, firm nodules, and
ulcerous sores.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>lymphatic glands</i> in the line of circulation from the infected
centres are constantly involved. Hypertrophy, congestion,
serous infiltration, and rapid cell proliferation are present and a
section will usually show caseated or caseopurulent centres confined
by the outer dense fibrous envelope. Exceptionally, these
necrosed contents will escape through an ulcerous opening, forming
a deep cavity which is slow and difficult to heal. In the vicinity
of these glands and in the loose intermuscular connective
tissue abscesses of the size of an egg or an orange or larger are
sometimes met with.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nodules and ulcers are found on the pharyngeal and intestinal
mucosa, similar to those of the larynx.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spleen, and less frequently the liver, may be the seat of
caseating nodules exactly comparable to those of the lungs.
Glanders of the kidney is rare.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nodules have been seen on the ventricular endocardium and
one case of nodules of the choroid plexus (Boschetti).</p>

<p class='c008'>In stallions, glanderous, caseating foci in the <i>testicle</i> and dropsy
of the scrotum are common, while mares may have similar formations
in the mammary glands or ulcers of the vaginal or uterine
mucosa.</p>

<p class='c008'>Infiltrations of the joints and other synovial cavities are not
uncommon and glanderous infiltration of the bones with caries is
also found. In chronic cases, fragility of the bone is marked,
and the blood contains an excess of leucocytes. These may be
traced to disease of the bone marrow, as well as of the spleen and
lymphatic system.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GLANDERS IN SWINE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The healthy, vigorous pig is practically immune. Experimental
inoculations have uniformly failed to produce the disease.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Exception must be made when inoculation is made into the aqueous
humor, in which there is comparatively little resistance by leucocytes.
Sacharoff succeeded in giving the disease in a fatal form
to a young pig in this way. To weak and debilitated pigs, on
the other hand, the disease may be conveyed as shown by Spinola,
and Cadeac and Malet. The symptoms were engorgement of the
tissues in the seat of inoculation with the formation of glanderous
nodules, which undergo molecular degeneration and ulceration;
swelling of the lymph vessels extending from the infected point,
and of the adjacent lymph glands; the formation of glander
nodules in the lungs, liver and spleen, and of nodules and ulcers
on the nasal mucosa.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GLANDERS IN SHEEP AND GOAT.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Casual glanders is uncommon in the small ruminants, yet it
has been seen in goats that fed on the soiled provender left by
glandered horses (Ercolani, Trasbot, Mesnard). Sheep have
suffered after inoculation (Renault, Bonley, Gerlach, Bollinger,
Croker, Peuch, Galtier) showing nodules and ulcerous swellings
in the seat of inoculation, with extension in some cases to the
nasal mucosa and lungs, and a fatal result. In other cases the
lesions remain localized and the disease progresses to recovery.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GLANDERS OF RODENTS: RABBIT, GUINEA-PIG, MOUSE, RAT.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The <i>Guinea-pig</i> is especially susceptible, and like the rabbit
and mouse may contract the disease by eating the soiled fodder
of glandered horses. It is usually selected for inoculation for
diagnostic purposes, because in the male, the insertion of the
virus in the peritoneum determines a rapid swelling of the testicle
and cord, with a glistening, violet engorgement and tension of
the scrotum, suppurative adenitis and death in three to six days.
In other situations the inoculated part swells rapidly and ulcerates,
the adjacent lymph glands become swollen and tender, similar
lesions form in other parts and notably in the nose which discharges
profusely a whitish, sticky fluid, the breathing is hurried,
and emaciation is marked. Death occurs in a few days and ulcers,
and abscesses are found in the lungs and other internal organs,
as well as in the nose. In less susceptible subjects or under
smaller doses of the virus the local swelling and ulceration in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>seat of inoculation are slight, but there persist engorgements of
the adjacent lymph glands, swelling (cording) of the lymph vessels
adjacent, and nodules and abscesses, (cutaneous, subcutaneous,
intermuscular, intravisceral), arthritis, emaciation, dyspnœa
and death in two to four months. In some cases with a very
small dose of the poison, there is no local swelling, and no generalization
nor subsequent manifestation of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>rabbit</i> the lesions are less certain and often less marked.
There is sometimes no swelling in the seat of inoculation, in the
neighboring lymph glands, nor elsewhere, and the rodent might
have been supposed to have escaped, only that successful inoculation
of the ass may be made from the tissues inoculated (Galtier).
In such a case a certain immunity of the rabbit must be inferred.
In less resistant rabbits, or with a larger dose, an ulcerous swelling
forms in the seat of inoculation, the adjacent lymph glands
become engorged or even purulent, corded lymphatics intervene,
and nodules and caseous degenerations appear in the lungs, nose,
spleen, liver, and other organs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>hedgehog</i>, <i>ground squirrel</i>, the <i>field mouse</i>, <i>house mouse</i>,
<i>mole</i> have been successfully inoculated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>frog</i> immersed in water at 30° C., forms a good culture
ground for the bacillus which may be found in its blood, in pure
cultures, from the second to the fifty-fifth day. These cause no
local lesion, nor obvious, constitutional disorder. It seems possible
that, in summer, the infection may be propagated by frogs in
the drinking water.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GLANDERS IN CARNIVORA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>All carnivora are liable to contract glanders by eating the flesh
of glandered horses, asses and mules, and this has been noted
especially in menageries. <i>Lions</i>, <i>tigers</i>, <i>bears</i> and <i>wolves</i>, have
shown the ulcerous lesions in the nose, and the nodules in the
lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys and elsewhere. The carcass of the
diseased horse is, however, often devoured without evil result,
and even when the carnivora become affected the disease is not
always fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>dog</i>, experimental glanders has been closely studied by
many observers. Casual glanders has been contracted by living
with the glandered horse; by licking his nasal or other discharges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>and by eating his flesh. The disease has also been conveyed
from dog to dog by licking each other. In many cases even inoculated
glanders produces only a local ulcerous inflammatory
lesion with or without hard swelling of the adjacent lymphatics,
and engorgement of the lymph glands. After a rather tardy
granulation and cicatrisation, the symptoms subside and the
animal is restored to health. Yet such benignity does not depend
on any lessened virulence of the bacillus, for an inoculation of the
discharges on the ass produces acute and fatal glanders.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>GLANDERS IN MAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Recognized by Lorin 1812. Causes: infection from soliped, man less susceptible;
infection from man, clothing, stable bucket, inhalation, etc.; industrial
disease; native immunity. <i>Symptoms</i>: incubation; mistaken for
carbuncle, small pox, measles, erysipelas, anthrax; anamnesis; anthrax
focus has darker center, no caseation, no corded lymphatics; nodules and
ulcers in nose, swollen submaxillary glands and lymph vessels, general illness,
diarrhœa, vomiting, dyspnœa, mental derangement, stupor, coma, internal
deposits, bloody sputa, fœtid breath, hepatic pain, icterus, muscles,
bones, bowels, typhoid, pyæmic, osteo-myelitic, or acute tuberculous symptoms.
Death in 3 days to 4 weeks. Chronic cases, cutaneous, muscular, osseous,
skin nodules in group or chain, glandular swellings. Diagnosis from
pyæmia by lack of chills, and the sanious pus; from syphilis by futility of
potassium iodide, and history; inoculate ox or white mouse; find bacillus.
Lesions: as in horse, more early coagulation necrosis, ulceration, abscess;
pus more viscid than in pyæmia, walls of abscess more irregular, lymphoid
cell proliferation more abundant and extended (glands, spleen, liver, lung,
nose, etc.), history; distinguished from variola, rötheln, and erysipelas by
the many miliary or pea-like neoplasms with cellular caseating centres;
lymphoid deposits in bone marrow, with friability.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until the early part of the present century glanders in man was
not traced to its origin in the soliped. Lorin in 1812 recorded a
case in which the human hand had been accidentally inoculated
from handling a horse suffering from farcy. Soon other cases
were put on record by Waldinger and Weith, Muscroft, Schilling,
Rust, Sedow, and a host of followers. Later Rayer, Tardieu,
Virchow, Leisering, Gerlach and Koránye have thrown much
light on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Etiology.</i> Man is manifestly less susceptible than the soliped,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>considering the great number of exposures relatively to the victims.
Yet the infection of man is altogether too common to be
lightly passed over. The infection is almost always derived
directly or indirectly from the horse, yet a number of cases have
been derived from the human being through handling the dishes,
towels or handkerchiefs of a patient, dressing his wounds, or performing
a necropsy. Other cases like that of Dr. Hoffmann of
Vienna, came from handling artificial cultures of the bacillus
mallei.</p>

<p class='c008'>Glanders is preëminently an industrial disease, attacking persons
of the following occupations: hostlers 42, farmers and horse
owners 19, horse butchers 13, coachmen and drivers 11, veterinarians
and veterinary students 10, soldiers 5, surgeons 4, gardeners
3, horse dealers 2, policeman, shepherd, blacksmith, employe
at a veterinary school, and washerwoman, 1 each.</p>

<p class='c008'>The modes of transmission are essentially the same as in the
animal. In the great majority of cases there has been the direct
contact of the infecting discharges with a wound of the human
victim. Handling the diseased horse with injured hands, giving
him a bolus and scratching the hand on the teeth, examining
the nose, sleeping under a blanket which has been used on a
glandered horse, removing the dressings of such an animal or
performing a post mortem examination on him are familiar examples.
The particles scattered by the diseased animal in
snorting, will infect the mucous membrane of the eye or nose,
and all the more readily if these are already sore or abraded.
Infection of man by ingestion has been discredited mainly because
the carcasses of glandered horses have often been eaten with
impunity; but this may be largely accounted for by cooking, the
bacillus being destroyed by a temperature of 131° F. Carnivora
such as dogs, cats, lions, polar bears and prairie dogs have been
infected by feeding. Men also have been infected through
drinking from the same bucket after a glandered horse. After
making full allowance for the inimical action of the gastric juice,
we must admit that this has often failed, and there is the added
danger of abrasions of the lips, mouth and throat and of the
entrance of the microbe into the tonsillar follicles and gland ducts.
Still other cases are recorded of men sleeping in stables, but not
handling horses, who contracted glanders, presumably, through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>the dust borne bacillus inhaled. The bacillus, is however, so
readily destroyed by thorough desiccation that this mode of transmission
is exceptional. Some men are immune to glanders, and
suffer only when predisposed through a course of ill health, and
yet a large proportion of the cases on record have been in strong
hearty men.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of Glanders in Man.</i> In man as in the horse, glanders
occurs in the <i>acute</i> and <i>chronic forms</i>. In the <i>acute</i> supervening
on an external inoculation, <i>incubation</i> is from one to four days.
When it enters through other channels it may seem to extend to
a week or more.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a skin abrasion has been inoculated it will show in a few
days a soft inflammatory swelling or a firm nodule with a puffy
reddish areola, and it may be mistaken for a carbuncle. In not a
few cases the small nodule has been mistaken for small pox. In
my experience a horsemen on a ranch on which over a hundred
horses showed glanders, died of an ulcerous skin affection which
was variously supposed to be a malignant small pox and measles,
though neither malady was known to exist in the district. Other
cases are confounded with gangrenous erysipelas. The absence of
these other affections from the locality, and the fact that the
patient was employed about glandered horses, should go far to
correct such mistakes. The early supervention of ulceration is
further diagnostic, and discovery of the bacillus mallei in the
products will be conclusive. From anthrax it is easily distinguished
by the absence of the dark centre of the sore in the early
stages, and of the large sized bacillus anthracis. The caseation
or liquefaction of the necrotic centre further distinguishes it from
the characteristic anthrax slough, and the thickening and induration
of the lymphatic walls are not present in anthrax. Sometimes
the inoculated case proves mild and recovers in two or three
weeks with healing of the ulcer, but in other cases there is an
extension to adjacent tissue and a general infection with the
supervention of nasal glanders.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a spread of the erysipelatoid inflammation and swelling,
and the formation in such newly invaded tissue of nodules
and ulcers in successive crops. In acute cases too, the nasal
mucosa becomes involved with the formation of the nodules and
ulcers that are so pathognomonic in the horse. The discharge is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>then somewhat sticky and often tinged with blood. In acute cases
according to Senn, the nose may be completely destroyed and deep
facial ulcers may be formed in a week. The submaxillary
glands are enlarged and painful and the facial lymphatic vessels
leading from these to the nose may be red, thickened and tender.
Suppuration and ulceration of the glands may ensue. Headache,
prostration, nausea, inappetence and vomiting with diarrhœa
usually supervene. Then follow dyspnœa, wakefulness, troubled
dreams, anxiety, nocturnal delirium, stupor and coma. The
pulse may rise to 120 and the temperature to 104° F.</p>

<p class='c008'>There may be various complications as deposits in the lungs
with pain in the chest, weak cough, aphonia, bloody expectoration
and offensive breath; or the morbid process may take place
in the liver or spleen with pain in the hypochondrium and much
prostration and even icterus; or the muscles, bones, joints or
testicle may suffer and the symptoms may suggest typhoid fever,
pyæmia, osteomyelitis, or acute general miliary tuberculosis.
The bacillus can usually be detected in the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Acute glanders may prove fatal in three days or it may be
prolonged for two, three or even four weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Chronic glanders</i> in man usually confines itself to the cutaneous
muscular and osseous systems. It may take on an indolent type
with the formation of skin nodules in groups or chains which remain
hard and show no tendency to soften nor ulcerate. The
adjacent lymphatic glands may become enlarged and indurated
and the affection strongly resembles tuberculosis of the skin.
Later when the nodules have softened and formed irregular and
obstinate ulcers with swollen lymphatic glands, the disease is
easily mistaken for syphilis. From pyæmia and septicæmia it is
usually to be distinguished by the comparative absence of chills,
and by the more sanious character of the pus. From syphilis it
may be distinguished by the futility of a course of potassium iodide,
and the general history of the case and probable exposure of the
patient, and for tuberculosis the same principles will apply. In
case of uncertainty, inoculation may be resorted to on the horse in
suspected syphilis and on the pig when there is suspicion of
tuberculosis. Or conversely the ox may be employed for the latter
disease as he is altogether insusceptible to glanders. As a
last resort the discovery of the bacillus may be made or the
mallein test may be adopted with the concurrence of the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span><i>Pathological Anatomy and Diagnosis.</i> This is fundamentally
the same as in the horse. The bacillus and its toxic products act
on the infected tissues to produce clusters of lymphoid cells in a
fibrous stroma after the manner of tuberculosis. Like that disease
it also tends to affect primarily the lymph channels and glands,
showing a particular tendency to the respiratory mucosa and has
a great disposition to early coagulation, necrosis, ulceration, suppuration
and abscess. The giant cell of tuberculosis is not a
prominent feature in glanders, and the disposition to suppuration
is greater especially in the human being so that the disease often
resembles pyæmia. As in solipeds, however, the glander abscess
has somewhat more sanious or glairy contents and the investing
wall is not smooth and regular, but uneven and ulcerous from the
successive softening and discharge of the clusters of degenerating
lymphoid cells in the adjacent tissue. The pallor of the adjacent
tissues from exudation and from the presence of numerous nests
of lymphoid cells, the thickening of the efferent lymphatics, and
the presence of numerous lymphoid neoplasms in the adjacent
glands, and tissues, and often in the internal organs such as the
liver and spleen and in the nasal mucosa or lungs together with
the history of the patient’s exposure to glanders serve to diagnose
from pyæmia. From smallpox and rötheln the skin lesions are
distinguished by the presence of a central coagulation necrosis
bathed in a glairy seropurulent fluid, and by the infiltration and
thickening of the efferent lymphatic trunks. It differs from erysipelas
in the same way by the presence in the affected tissues of
the small hard lymphoid masses of embryonal tissue, and in a
more advanced stage by the granular fatty debris resulting from
their fatty degeneration. The presence in the affected tissue of
these miliary or pea-like neoplasms in all stages of development
from the primary congestion, through the embryonal tissue to the
coagulation necrosis and caseation or softening is characteristic of
the lesions of glanders. The sanious, sticky or glairy pus is especially
noticed in the newly opened abscess, as after exposure to
the air it is speedily infected with pus microbes, and the discharge
becomes less serous and more creamy. Another characteristic of
glanders in man is the frequent implication of the bone marrow,
and the formation of the lymphoid deposits in the cancellated tissue
until the bone may be reduced to a mere friable shell. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>when the disease is localized in the nasal mucosa it extends rapidly,
not only to the skin and muscles, but also to the cartilage and
bones of the face, so that deep, wide, perforating and destructive
ulcers are common. The enlarged ends of the long bones of
the limbs are favorite seats of the lesion, and the synovial membrane
of the joints and the articular cartilage often bear centres of
lymphoid proliferation. Though usually small the intermuscular
neoplasms may form abscesses as large as a hen’s egg. The affected
muscle appears pale, degenerated and granular with foci of
lymphoid cell growth. The swelling of the lymph glands is
usually less than in the soliped though the same in character.
The pulmonary neoplasms are histologically almost indistinguishable
from tubercle, though the comparative absence of the giant
cell, the different staining qualities of the bacillus, and the coincident
lesions in the upper air passages, with the cord like infiltration
of the walls of the lymphatics may assist in diagnosis. Diagnostic
inoculation may be made on the basis of the susceptibility
of the ox and white mouse to tuberculosis, and their insusceptibility
to glanders; also the partial insusceptibility of the soliped
to tuberculosis and his marked susceptibility to glanders.</p>

<p class='c008'>The characteristic nodules and abscesses may be found in different
internal organs such as the stomach, intestine, liver, spleen,
kidneys, testicles and brain, especially in acute cases, whereas
the lesions of the skin and nose are more common in chronic
cases.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT OF GLANDERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Extinction. Exclusion, in Australia, New Zealand, English army. Occision
of infected, and disinfection of stables, harness, vehicles, utensils,
manure and other infected things, mallein diagnosis; attendants should
avoid handling suspicious horses, except with sound hands, and disinfect
latter. Sheep living in horse stables, tested before slaughter, or inspected
after. Malleinization on Plains and in high, dry air, in secluded herds:
less hopeful elsewhere. Mallein test for all solipeds from glanders districts,
and imported horses. Treatment illegal in many states, so that justice
would require extinction with indemnities. Successful on high tablelands
and mountains. Demands careful segregation and disinfection. Acute
cases always hopeless: chronic skin cases more promising. Antiseptic injection
of unbroken nodules (carbolic acid, potassium permanganate), also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of open sores (mercuric chloride, iodized phenol, cupric sulphate, saturated,
zinc chloride), excise nodule. For delicate mucous surfaces Lugol’s solution
of iodine or iodized phenol diluted. Tonics: arseniate of strychnia,
copper biniodide, baryta nitrate, iron sulphate, sulphites, bisulphites, hyposulphites,
phenic acid, open air life at pasture, or thorough ventilation,
sunshine, moderate exercise, generous, partly grain diet. Mild cases in
separate herd, in secluded, wide pasture with rich diet, including grain,
and shelter in clean, comfortable shed at will, under tonics and antiseptics,
tested by mallein at intervals, to be restored individually to work after two
or more tests without reaction. Serum of immune animals subcutem.
Treatment in man: surgically as in the horse, excision, curetting, antisepsis,
abscesses opened and disinfected; iodoform insufflations, antiseptic
gases, sprays and solutions. Internally: tonics, sulphocarbolates, iron
muriate, iodides, phenic acid, quinia, strychnia, arsenite, stimulants, serum
treatment, pure air, out door life, rich, digestible food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Radical efforts at prevention must look to the extinction of
the disease in the soliped, and its complete exclusion from Australia
and New Zealand shows that such a result is not unattainable.
In the English army where every glandered horse is at
once killed and all pertaining to him disinfected, the disease is
now virtually unknown except in the case of newly purchased
horses or regiments operating in the field. In the French army
which formerly lost 9 per cent. per annum from glanders, now
under similar precautions loses but .5 percent. A law providing
for the prompt destruction of every glandered soliped and the
safe disinfection of carcasses, stables, harness, vehicles, utensils,
fodder, litter and manure that have been exposed to contamination,
if enforced, would soon eradicate the disease. But this law
should provide efficient machinery for its enforcement, and,
under suitable safe guards, an appropriate indemnity for the
owner. With the use of mallein in all infected studs, as a diagnostic
agent, the campaign can be made sharp, short and effective,
instead of waiting as in the past for the slow development of occult
cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest and most fundamental error in veterinary sanitary
legislation is the lack of a guarded indemnity for the animals
killed. I strongly urged this fact on the committee of the
N. Y. legislature in 1898 but to no purpose. A bill was passed
forbidding all indemnity for glandered horses, and an impetus
thus given to the spread of the disease is daily bearing fruit in
our great cities especially, disastrous to the health of the horses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and a constant menace to that of humanity as well. The law
makes it the duty of veterinarians to report all cases of glanders,
but in great horse establishments such a report would stop the
use of the whole stable, at a loss of thousands of dollars per diem,
and put a sudden end to the employment of the reporting practitioner
by the firm or corporation in question. The owner of one
or two horses can afford to report, the loss of these and their
work does not mean absolute ruin, but the owner of hundreds
can not safely report. For owner and practitioner alike the alternatives
are presented of obedience to the law with personal
ruin on the one hand, and the surreptitious dealing with cases of
glanders and the preservation of their livelihoods on the other.
Whatever may be said as to the constitutionality of the law which
destroys private property without compensation under the right
of eminent domain, this is certain, that, as applied to animal
plagues, this course is unjust, oppressive, and not only useless,
but positively injurious, in that it drives the owners of animals
to such courses as favor the spread of the plague in place of restricting
it. To-day in New York City glanders is extensively
prevalent, but large horse owners dare not adopt the legal measures
for its extinction, with the certainty of great loss or ruin
staring them in the face as the result. It should be further considered
that any law is at once bad and vicious in its tendency
which places before the citizen the alternatives of disobedience
with profit, and obedience with loss or ruin. Such a law is the
worst possible economy because in preserving the infection, it
not only perpetuates the disease and its attendant losses for all
time, but perpetuates forever the official expenses of keeping it
in check, when a prompt extinction of the infection would once
for all time abolish all loss and all outlay for surveillance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Until provision can be made for the enforcement of our laws
against glanders, all who handle horses should be warned of the
danger of working about strange solipeds, or those that show suspicious
symptoms, while they have any sores on the hands, and
in case they must run any risk of contact with infection, to
promptly wash hands and face in a solution of hydrargyrum
chloride (1:2000), or carbolic acid (2:100). Animals of susceptible
races (sheep, etc.) which have lived with glandered
horses should be made to pass the mallein test before they can be
put upon the market for human food.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>In the high, dry altitudes of the Plains and Rocky Mountains,
where most cases of glanders are mild and the majority recover,
resort may be had to malleinization provided the patients are
kept safely secluded from all other horses. In some horses with
a native tendency to immunity, the oft repeated inoculation with
0.5cc. of mallein will render the animal refractory to the infection.
Animals that have recovered from casual attacks show the
same immunity. Among those who have experimented with
mallein may be named: Straus, Schneidemuhl, Semmer, Bonome,
and Vivaldi, Mowry and Michel, Schweinitz and Kilborne.
Sacharoff apparently secured immunity in the horse by inoculation
with virus modified by passing through the cat. Straus
found that dogs which had received mallein intravenously could
be made immune against intravenous inoculations, but, as Galtier
had already pointed out, were still susceptible to cutaneous inoculations.
Finger, experimenting on the rabbit, found that immunity
only resulted after a long series of inoculations. The
frequency of successful auto-inoculations in chronic cases of
glanders in the horse would tend to discredit the alleged value
of single injections of mallein, so that a long series is necessary
if we would aim at good results.</p>

<p class='c008'>Altogether attempts at immunizing the equine population generally,
are not hopeful where it is dense, where they must be kept
stabled, where the climate is moist and where glanders is deadly,
or tends to persist in the chronic form for years in the same animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Considering the prevalence of the disease in a mild form on
many of the western breeding ranches it is well to test all horses
arriving from the west. The same applies to solipeds imported

<p class='c015'>In the majority of the states the treatment of a glandered horse
is prohibited by statute. Yet without providing definite machinery
for the administration of the law, and without indemnities for
horses disposed of, such laws are largely inoperative. On the
other hand treatment is quite successful on the pastures of our
dry table lands and mountains. It can, however, be sanctioned
only when careful segregation and disinfection are provided for.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Acute cases of glanders are hopeless in any region, but chronic
cases and especially such as have the lesions confined to the skin
are much more hopeful.</p>

<p class='c008'>The unbroken nodules may be injected with carbolic acid solution
(1:200), or permanganate of potash (1:60). The open sores
on the skin may be treated with the same solutions, with mercuric
chloride (1:2000 to 1:5000), with iodized phenol, with cupric sulphate
(saturated solution), or with chloride of zinc. A primary
nodule may be excised and the sore treated with antiseptics.
When the lesions are very extensive the less poisonous agents
should be made use of, or tincture of iodine may be substituted.
The nose lesions may be treated by the weaker solutions of iodine
or of iodized phenol.</p>

<p class='c008'>Benefit also comes from a course of tonics the most successful
of which have been arseniate of strychnia, binodide of copper,
sulphate of copper, nitrate of baryta and sulphate of iron. The
sulphites, bisulphites and hyposulphites and phenic acid are desirable
adjuncts. An open air life at pasture is the ideal condition.
Otherwise thorough ventilation, sunshine, moderate exercise and
nourishing easily digestible food including grain are very important.</p>

<p class='c008'>When conditions are favorable and an absolutely secluded pasture
can be secured, with shelter from storms, and where civic or
state authorities do not take effective measures to stamp out glanders,
nor compensate owners for animals killed, mild, chronic and
cutaneous cases and occult ones that have reacted to mallein without
showing any other symptom, may be subjected to treatment.
They should have an open air life, a generous diet, including
grain, perfect cleanliness and pure air in the shelter-shed, an antiseptic
and tonic medication (sulphites, tonics) may be given, and
every three months a new mallein test may be applied. If the
individual horse passes two successive tests without reaction, and
shows no other indication of glanders, if his general health appears
perfect and his condition good, he may be returned to work
as a sound animal. With effective measures of extinction in force
on the other hand, and indemnity for the slaughtered animal, any
such measure would be entirely unwarrantable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Treatment by injecting the serum of immune animal subcutem
has given encouraging results. Helman, Semmer and Itzkovitch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Pilavios, Bonome and Vivaldi, Johne, Schindelka, Prieur and
others record recoveries in recent cases and there need be no doubt
of its value in subjects that are naturally somewhat refractory to the
germ. Babes introduced the blood serum of the ox, which is
naturally immune, and Prieur speaks with confidence of the treatment
of cutaneous glanders in man and certain cases of pulmonary
glanders in the horse.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>TREATMENT IN MAN.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The surgical treatment of glanders in man does not differ materially
from that given for animals. It is more frequently
possible to deal with the local lesion in its early stages and then
a thorough cauterization of the infected sore, and a little later the
complete excision of the primary nodule, or the limited regional
infiltration, the curetting of the adjacent parts and the maintenance
of thorough disinfection by irrigation, sponging and compress
will often be followed by success. Where such radical measures
are inadmissible the infected parts should be excised and curetted
as far as safe and the adjacent parts subjected to carbolic injections
(1:200). Abscesses should be evacuated, fistulæ slit
open, and thorough disinfection applied. For the affected air-passages,
iodoform insufflations and antiseptic gases, sprays, and
solutions should be freely used.</p>

<p class='c008'>Internally, antiseptics such as sulphocarbolates and tincture of
muriate of iron, iodides, and carbolic acid have been largely employed.
Whitla recommends 5 grains of quinia in 15 grains of
tincture of muriate of iron every four hours. Tonics (arsenate of
strychnia), and stimulants, ammoniacal or alcoholic, may be
called for. Special symptoms such as pain, rigors, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhœa and profuse perspirations must be met by suitable
remedies. Finally blood serum from healthy cattle or from immunized
animals may be employed subcutem. Pure air and
nourishing, easily digestible food are very essential. Every effort
should be made to check the disease at its outset, as generalized
acute glanders is speedily fatal, and recoveries in chronic cases
usually leave a broken down constitution.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LYMPHANGITIS SACCHAROMYCOTICA (FARCINOIDES: EPIZOÖTICA:ULCEROSA.) FARCY IN CATTLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Geographical distribution and nature: Japan, Northern Europe, France,
Guadaloupe; caseating nodules in skin, subcutem, in mucosæ and internal
organs. In <i>horse</i> skin nodules, and glandular abscesses, with thick ovoid
refrangent bacterium; saccharomyces (Hitt); swellings first local, then
multiple, and general, extending along lymph vessels to glands (Hitt);
along air-passages to lungs, from prepuce or scrotum to peritoneum (Hitt),
or from conjunctiva to other parts in the orbit (Caparini and Ferner). In
<i>cattle</i>, multiple, subcutaneous, nodules—hazlenut to walnut, isolated, hard,
painless. Suppurate slowly. Same saccharomyces (Tokishige, Nocard).
May invade lungs with fatal result in a year. Mallein test gives no reaction.
Treatment: actively antiseptic; open, curette, pack with antiseptic gauze,
sublimate bandages; internally, tonics, antiseptics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Horses and cattle in certain countries (Japan, Sweden, Finland,
France, Guadaloupe) are subject to a chronic lymphangitis resembling
cutaneous glanders, but associated with the development
of bacilli or fungi in the nodular, caseating swellings in the skin,
subcutem, in mucosæ and in internal organs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nocard describes the affection in the horse as characterized by
skin nodules (buttons, boils), which burst and discharge a thick,
grumous, or thin, oily, yellowish or bloody pus. The surrounding
lymph plexus swells up into corded lines, with at intervals
nodules or abscesses. The infection extends to and implicates
the lymph glands and general pyemia may follow. The thick
ovoid refrangent, pathogenic, bacterium stains in Gram’s solution.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Northern Europe and Asia, Southern Europe and Guadaloupe
an analogous affection is described by Rivolta, Claudio-Fermi,
Aruch, Tokishige and Nocard and Leclainche. Hitt
attributes this to saccharomyces. The infection attacks horses
and cattle, entering by sores and abrasions of the skin of the
limbs, or under the harness (back, breast, rump, head). Confined
at first to the point of infection it becomes multiple, being
conveyed from place to place, through the soil, floor, stall, harness,
blankets, brushes, combs, straw, etc., and may extend on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>the mucosæ. The wounds fester, forming pus and crusts over a
more or less considerable swelling. In a variable time, (one to
twenty weeks) the surrounding lymphatics become swollen and
tender (corded), and nodular swellings appear on their course
which fluctuate, burst and discharge a whitish or yellowish pus,
sometimes oily or slimy. The disease extends along the lymphatics,
invading the lymph glands and even the internal organs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tokishige describes cases in which it extended along the respiratory
mucosa, causing constriction of the nasal passages and
larger bronchi, with dyspnœa, and finally, invading the lung.
In other cases it spread from the prepuce, or scrotum, upward
along the tunica vaginalis, spermatic cord and testicle. Caparini
and Ferner describe it in the orbit, affecting the lids, nictitans,
conjunctiva and adjacent parts, with nodules and abscesses. Mazzanti
describes the case of a filly which died with pea-like nodules
on the colon, and ulceration, with dirty, black, purulent centres,
and indurated borders. Tokishige describes the affected cattle
as showing a vast number of subcutaneous, hard, painless
nodules, varying in size from a hazel nut to a walnut and covered
by light colored skin. The nodules were isolated and not connected
by swollen, beaded lymph vessels. They encrease and
suppurate much more slowly than in the horse. In three cows
microscopically examined he found apparently the same branching
fungus (saccharomyces), as in the horse cases. The mortality is
about 10 per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>farcy of the ox</i> of Guadaloupe there form subcutaneous
nodular abscesses, with cordiform swelling of the lymph plexus
and trunks, often proving fatal in a year through extension to
the lungs. The abscess breaks, discharging a whitish, creamy
or caseous, or grumous contents, containing a bacillus (Nocard).
The abscesses usually appear under the sternum or belly and
later extend to the thighs and legs. In all such cases the mallein
test is inoperative.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>treatment</i> of such cases should be actively antiseptic to
destroy the germ while still local. After opening and evacuating
the abscesses, excise or curette the diseased tissue, or destroy
with the actual cautery, pack the cavities with pledgets soaked
in tincture of iodine, iodized phenol creolin, lysol, mercuric
chloride, zinc chloride, or copper sulphate, or dusted with aristol,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>iodoform, or iodized starch. The surrounding swelling, if any,
may be painted with tincture of iodine, or covered with cloths
wet with a sublimate lotion or other antiseptic. Internally,
tonics and antiseptics may be given: arsenite of strychnia, quinia,
iron or copper sulphate, sulphites or hyposulphites of soda or
potash.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Canine madness; Rabidus Canis; Lyssa; Lytta;
Cynolyssa.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> Rabies is an acute, infectious disease, affecting
the cerebral and medullary nervous centres and characterized by
intellectual, emotional, aggressive and other nervous disorders
and by extreme reflex excitability.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span><i>Animals susceptible.</i> While the disease is seen most frequently
in the canine races (dogs, wolves, foxes and jackals), and in the
cat family (cat, lion), it is liable to spread widely among animals
that use the teeth as weapons of offense, and such as they can
readily attack. When inoculated, all warm blooded animals contract
the disease. Thus the carnivora and omnivora (dog, wolf,
fox, hyena, jackal, cat, lion, badger and skunk and, to a less
extent, the pig and horse) may become active propagators of the
infection, which may spread widely among their herbivorous victims
(cattle, sheep, goats, deer, rats, mice, chickens and pigeons)
through their bites. Man suffers mainly through the attacks of
dogs, cats and, in certain localities, wolves or skunks, but he is
also liable to become infected from handling rabid domestic
herbivora. Different genera differ in susceptibility, the receptivity
being apparently greatest in the carnivora.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> Rabies is confined to no country
nor climate but it attains its greatest prevalence in the north temperate
zone, where there is the densest population and where
activity of travel favors the propagation of infection. The facility
for inoculation is the one determining cause, thus the islands of
Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, the Azores and St. Helena
have never suffered and the first three exclude the disease by
rigid inspection and quarantine. During the Hamburg epizoötic
of 1852–53, the islands in the Elbe escaped though both banks
were ravaged. Again, where the muzzling of all dogs has been
rigidly enforced, as in many German cities and districts the disease
has been practically extirpated.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Etiology.</i> Long before the days of pathological bacteriology
rabies was recognized by veterinarians as a disease due to infection
alone. Its absence from the various countries above named,
and from South and West Africa, its rapid propagation in other
countries (La Plata, Malta, Hong Kong) into which it had been
introduced for the first time, and its restriction and disappearance
wherever muzzling had been strictly carried out, had practically
settled this question. The development of the disease in animals
which had been experimentally inoculated was no less significant
of this truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other alleged causes are based on secondary factors that favor
inoculation. The alleged evil influence of the hot season (dog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>days) is accounted for by the period of <i>rutting</i> of the dog which
occurs in spring, and brings together troops of jealous dogs following
individual bitches and fighting for their favors. This
gives a great impetus to the propagation of the disease which
accordingly becomes more prevalent during succeeding months.
The statistics of Bouley show, however, that the season of its
greatest prevalence in France is March, April and May, that it
subsides slowly up to midwinter and encreases again in spring.
Boudin’s statistics show the greatest number of cases in man
toward midsummer which is explained by the long period of
inoculation after bites sustained in the spring, but also because
clothing is lighter in summer and infection more likely to reach
the skin, and because the heat of the weather tends to cause
hyperthermia and encrease susceptibility.</p>

<p class='c008'>The large preponderance of male dogs among the victims of
rabies (7:1) has led to the theory that sex predisposes, but the
explanation is rather that the males bite each other in their
jealousy while they respect the female, the object of their sexual
passion. In inoculated cases, males, females, and castrated contract
the affection indifferently and with equal readiness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The skunk is found to be infected in certain localities, and it
has been claimed that the affection is native to this animal, and
that the form differs from that which prevails in the dog, but the
restriction of the disease to sharply circumscribed areas in
Michigan and Kansas, while skunks elsewhere show no such
malignant quality, demonstrates that this is but an accidental
infection of the family of the Mephitis in a given locality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men and children suffer in far greater numbers than women,
the difference being mainly due to the protection furnished the
female by the flowing skirt, though also in part because of the
more frequent contact of men with dogs.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Virulent Matters.</i> In 1813 Gruner and Count Salm demonstrated
the virulent properties of the saliva of the rabid dog.
This has been many times repeated, though as shown by Pasteur,
Raynaud, and others, inoculations with saliva often kill in one or
two days by reason of the presence of other infective germs, or
suppuration ensues and destroys the rabific virus so that oftentimes
not more than one in four develops rabies. Galtier succeeded
in inoculating 3 rabbits, 1 dog and 1 sheep with the juice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>expressed from the salivary glands, and Nocard, Leclainche and
Peuch have found this to be very virulent. Paul Bert found the
bronchial mucus virulent. Rabies has been frequently conveyed
by consuming the bodies of rabid animals, yet Peuch and Galtier
have failed to convey infection by the flesh. Eckel and Lafosse
successfully inoculated the blood of goat to sheep, of man to dog
and of dog to dog. Yet many of the older observers agree with
Peuch and Galtier in pronouncing the blood non-virulent. Pasteur,
Roux, Bujwid, and Helman failed to obtain virulent cultures
from blood. Peuch and Nocard have found the milk virulent,
and Bardach found the same to be the case in a woman for two
days before her death of rabies. In some partially refractory
animals like the sheep, the blood seems to destroy the virus, as
intravenous inoculations have been made with impunity. The
probability is that the blood is habitually non-virulent in the early
stages and in mild cases, but becomes virulent in violent and
advanced cases. Pasteur first showed that the virus has a special
election for the brain and nervous matter and that the central
nervous organs are constantly infecting. Rossi inoculated with a
piece of nerve trunk, and Doubouc and Babes advanced the
hypothesis that the virus advances along the nerve to reach the
brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was formerly supposed that the saliva of omnivora and herbivora
was non-virulent but repeated experiment has proved it to be
infecting. The blunder was due to the fact that these animals did
not often transmit the disease by biting. Some writers even deny
that rabies exists at all as an infectious disease. One alleges that
the danger of rabies is “<i>less than the gallows</i>.” Experiment
shows most conclusively that it is much more certain when the
conditions are fulfilled. One may live a long lifetime without
seeing a genuine case of rabies, but so he may without seeing leprosy
or plague, and he is no more entitled to doubt their existence than
he is the existence of Manila, or of the other side of the moon.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Morbific Agent.</i> The actual factor which produces rabies is not
certainty known so that we cannot speak of its bacteriology.
That it is due to a specific particulate germ is now indisputable.
Paul Bert and Nocard filtered the virulent fluid through plaster
and found the clear fluid that had passed through non-virulent.
Rivolta, Babes, Bouchard and Peuch severally passed a solution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>of the rabific brain matter through a Chamberland filter and found
the clear filtrate harmless. The virulent agent is therefore not a
body in solution but a solid (organism) which is held back by the
filter. Hallier, Klebs, Galtier, Gibier, Pasteur, Fol, Babes and
Dowdeswell have respectively attempted the cultivation and inoculation
of organisms found in rabific liquids but none has stood
the test of further experiment. Memmo found a blastomyces in
the brains of six rabid rabbits and one hydrophobic child. It
stains with the aniline dyes but not by Gram’s method; when
thrown into the peritoneum of Guinea pigs it produced clonic
spasms and death in 24 hours, and in the dog, after an incubation
of 8 days caused emaciation, salivation, a disposition to bite,
paralysis of the hind limbs and death in 48 hours. Bruschettini
using agar or bouillon, containing lecithin or cerebrin and defibrinated
dog’s blood, inoculated with pieces of the brain of an inoculated
rabbit, obtained in 24 to 36 hours a group of small transparent
drop-like colonies at first microscopic, but becoming larger
with each new culture on fresh media. These colonies contained
a very small, short, thick bacillus, which stains readily in Ziehl’s
carbol-fuchsin, and then presents a central clear band giving the
appearance of a diploccus. In fluid media spherical forms are
produced, but in fresh cultures the diploccus aspect reappears. Injected
subdurally in rabbits it gave rise to what appeared to be
paralytic rabies and could be inoculated from animal to animal,
with similar results. It failed to grow in the usual culture media
from which the brain products are absent, thus fulfilling the conditions,
of a microbe the point of election of which was the nerve
cells. Marx who has sought for Bruschettini’s organism in 60
cases of rabies has only once found anything resembling it and
concludes that it was merely a contaminating organism, which
caused a paralysis (Centr. f. Bacter. 1896.)</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Viability of the poison.</i> Galtier found that the virulent saliva
remained potent for 11 days if preserved from drying. It persists
for 3 weeks in the brain and medulla kept at 0° to 12° C., for a
month in sealed tubes, or for several months if protected against
septic microbes and in contact with carbon dioxide.</p>

<p class='c008'>In water it is preserved for 20 to 38 days so that water soiled
with saliva may easily become a means of infection. In graves it
has been found virulent as long as 44 days after burial so that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>medico-legal cases results may be obtained by exhuming a suspected
animal (Galtier).</p>

<p class='c008'>Haubner found that drying the saliva in thin layers rendered it
non-virulent and Pasteur has shown that the rabbit’s medulla loses
its virulence in 14 or 15 days when dried in contact with air, and
apart from putrefaction. Such laboratory results must however
be qualified by the facts recorded by Blaine, Youatt and others in
which hound after hound died of rabies from living in a dry
kennel in which a rabid animal had preceded them. Until we
know something of the living germ itself of rabies, it is unwise
to infer too positive results from experiments on that microbe, in
what may be but one stage of its existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The virus is very resistant to cold, having survived a temperature
of −60° C. (−76° F.) for several hours (Roux), −10° C.
(−14° F.) for ten months (Jobert). Virulence is destroyed
however by a temperature of 48° C. (118.4° F.) in five to twenty
minutes (Galtier). Light destroys the virulence in 14 hours at
30° to 35° C. (Celli), but encreased pressure has little effect on it
(16 atmospheres, Nocard and Roux).</p>

<p class='c008'>Glycerine at room temperature preserves the medulla in its full
potency for four weeks, but destruction ensues if it is heated
(Protopopoff). An aqueous solution of iodine (6:100) destroys
the virulence (Galtier), as does also citric acid, bromine, chlorine,
sulphurous acid, the mineral acids and cupric sulphate.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Ratio of successful inoculation to bites of rabid animals.</i> As
rabies is usually transmitted by the bite, it is well to note that
not all the bites of rabid animals are effective. Of 183 dogs
confined with and bitten by a rabid dog 91 contracted rabies; of
73 cattle bitten 45 became rabid; out of 121 sheep bitten 51 succumbed
and of 890 persons bitten, 428 took hydrophobia. Of
440 persons bitten by rabid wolves 291 contracted the disease.
The escape of such a large proportion is variously accounted for.
Wolves naturally attack the face, throat or hands where there is
no protection by clothing, and inoculation is therefore much more
certain. Dogs, especially in cold weather usually bite man
through the clothes which wipe off the virus from the smooth
conical teeth before they reach the skin. Long haired animals
are often protected in the same way. In other cases the bite is
sustained on a very vascular part and the free flow of blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>washes out the poison. In still other cases the rabid animal
making a number of snaps in rapid succession comes to the last
with the teeth wiped clean and harmless. Again the prompt
washing or cauterizing of the wound tends often to protect
against infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under favorable circumstances however every bite infects,
and the writer has seen six animals, bitten in the same stable, all
contract rabies, while a man bitten through the coat sleeve by the
same dog, and cauterized an hour later entirely escaped. If the
bites are multiple, deep and irregular, the danger is greater.</p>

<p class='c008'>The licking of wounds is an occasional mode of infection, the
rabid dog in the early stages of the disease sometimes showing
an unusual disposition to fawn upon his owner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again particles of saliva may be projected by sneezing or
otherwise and lodge on sores, or on the mucosa of the nose, eye
or lip so as to cause infection. Galtier has conveyed the disease
experimentally to rabbits in 11 cases out of 75 by making them
breathe the atomized infecting liquid, or by dropping it into the
nose. In the same way he infected Guinea pigs and sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'>Galtier and Bujwid have conveyed the disease, exceptionally,
to rabbits and rats by feeding infecting emulsions. Galtier has
also produced rabies in ⅒th to ⅓d of the cases operated on by
instilling the virus into the eye.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> The duration of incubation varies with the species,
individual, the seat and character of the bite, the amount of virus
instilled, the potency of the virus, the age, size and weight of the
subject, the excitement of <i>rutting</i>, climatic or weather vicissitudes,
fatigue, and nervous or febrile disorders.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>dog</i> incubation <a id='t266'></a>ranges from 15 to 60 days, and perhaps 4
to 6 months. It is claimed to have lasted a year but this is somewhat
doubtful. In <i>cats</i> it has varied from 15 to 60 days.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>solipeds</i> it ranges usually from 20 to 45 days. The extremes
stated are 15 days and 20 months.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>cattle</i> it ranges from 14 to 50 days (exceptionally 70 days),
in <i>sheep</i> and <i>swine</i> from 14 to 60 days. It has been claimed to
have lasted 4 months in swine and 5 months in sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>rabbits</i> subdural inoculation has an incubation of 15 days,
shortening in 25 removes to 8 days, and finally to 6.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>man</i> incubation is alleged to be even more varied. The
rule is from 14 to 64 days, but it is claimed to have been as short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>as three days and as long as 1 to 12 years (Chabert). In the
human being, however, there is always the danger of the disease
caused by simple dread (lyssophobia) and until these protracted
cases can be verified by successful inoculation on the lower
animals, they must be held as extremely doubtful. The Montpellier
cadet has been often quoted who left, a few days after he
had been bitten, spent ten years in Holland, then returning to
the school and learning for the first time that his fellow cadet,
who had been bitten by the same dog, had gone mad, he too
became rabid without loss of time. Such cases have often been
cured by moral suasion and have been seized upon to corroborate
the heresy that there is no such thing as genuine rabies in man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any incubation, in man or beast which has exceeded 40 days
should be considered as doubtful, until certified by the successful
inoculation of rabbits or other small animals. For casual inoculations
the incubation rarely varies much from the time embraced
between 16 and 30 days. It is abridged by a special receptivity;
by an overdose of the poison; by the inoculation of a virus of
unusual potency; by the youth of the animal inoculated; by
great heat of the weather; by all forms of violent excitement;
by <i>rutting</i>; and by the inoculation of the virus on the head and
above all on the cerebral meninges. By this last method incubation
may be reduced to 6 days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Dogs.</i> In dogs as in other animals rabies is
manifested in two great types: the <i>furious</i> and the <i>dumb</i> or
<i>paralytic</i>, which, however, usually succeed each other in fully
developed cases. Yet the <i>furious</i> phenomena may be entirely
omitted, and again the victim may die in the early <i>furious</i> stage
so that the paralytic does not appear. The prominence of one
form over the other is to some extent determined by the germ
derived from a previous case of the same kind or by the family,
temperament and habits, bull dogs and hounds being specially
subject to the furious type, and house and pet dogs having rather
the paralytic form.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>premonitory symptoms</i> are in the main the same for both
types, and as these may enable us to recognize the disease before
the period of extreme danger, it is especially important that they
should be well understood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some marked change in the disposition or habits of the animal
is the first obvious variation from health, and in a district or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>country where rabies exists any such change should be the warrant
for instant seclusion of the dog before there is any disposition
to bite. The unwonted habit may be of almost any kind.
The lively, amiable dog may become suddenly dull, apathetic or
taciturn; the quiet, unexcitable dog may become unusually affectionate,
fawning and demonstrative, licking the owner’s hands and
face and perhaps infecting him before any suspicion is aroused.
Sudden capricious changes from fawning to apathy or sullenness,
or the opposite, should be dreaded. The noisy dog may become
suddenly silent; while the silent dog may take to howling without
apparent cause. A great restlessness, watchfulness or nervousness,
a tendency to start at the slightest sound, and a disposition
to move at frequent intervals in search of an easier position or
place to lie in, are most dangerous symptoms. A morbid appetite,
with a disposition to pick up and swallow all sorts of nonalimentary
objects (straw, thread, cord, paper, pins, nails, coal,
marbles, pebbles, cloth, earth, dung or urine), in a mature dog
is most suggestive. Searching around, scraping, tearing sticks,
clothes and other objects to pieces, licking of smooth cold stone
or metal, of his penis, or of the generative organs of a bitch, are
often early phenomena. The dog may hide in a dark corner,
going to sleep and grumbling or growling when disturbed. He
may make night hideous with his howls, <i>baying at the moon</i>. He
may stand with a dull, melancholy, hopeless expression of countenance,
as if beseeching his master for relief from his nameless
suffering. But as yet there is no disposition to bite. The dog
still responds to the call of the master, but with dulness and
apathy, in marked contrast with his usual prompt, alert and
loving response. There may be congestion, itching and irritation
in the seat of the bite, and it may be licked, scratched or gnawed
until raw, tender or bleeding. An early change in the voice
may be noticeable. There is at first a certain hoarseness, which
gradually develops into the pathognomonic rabid howl which is
quite recognizable at a distance. The dog turns his nose upward,
and with open mouth, emits a howl which, at first hoarse and
low, rises into a shriller and higher note before completion and
which may be repeated several times without closing the mouth.
It is not an ordinary howl but rather a cry of distress, and, to
the educated ear a grave note of warning. Sometimes the dog is
dumb from the start.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Close observation will often detect evidence of mental delusions
and hallucinations even at this early stage. The apparently
sleeping dog suddenly starts up with an air of suspicion and excitement.
His eyes may turn after phantom flies or other objects
at which he will presently snap. He moves hither and
thither with a curious, inquisitive air, searching in dark corners,
or under curtains or articles of furniture for some imaginary object.
He may stand in attentive attitude listening to fancied
sounds, and then bound in that direction in spite of an obstructing
wall or utensil. If recalled to reality by his master’s voice
his healthy attitude and affection may be completely though
temporarily restored. He may compose himself to rest or sleep,
and soon again start a victim to further delusions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>furious stage</i> is ushered in by a more pronounced manifestation
of the above symptoms. The rabid howl is more frequent
and characteristic. The insomnia and the restless movements,
change of place, searching, scratching or tearing are
likely to be more prominent. The delusions and the watching
or snapping at phantoms are more marked. The causeless sniffing
and scraping may imply disorder of the sense of smell. The
exalted hyperæsthesia and reflex excitability is usually a most
marked feature, frequently modified by a sinister, inimical or
malevolent disposition. Some subjects show evidence of intense
itching, most marked perhaps in the seat of the wound; others
are abnormally sensitive to currents of cold air; they start at the
slightest noise, a flash of light, a touch, or the approach of a
stranger. A paroxysm of fury may be caused at once by shaking
a stick at the patient, but, above all, by the test of presenting a
dog before his eyes. He at once rouses himself and, with flashing
eyes, dashes himself on his supposed enemy and bites viciously,
but without bark or growl. The sudden and mute attack is
pathognomonic. But there may be symptoms suggestive of
some hypoæsthesia. A blow from the dog’s master is usually
borne in silence. The animal shrinks from the blow but does
not yelp nor howl. During a paroxysm he will lacerate his gums
or loosen his teeth by biting on a stick or iron bar; he will even
seize a red hot bar without shrinking. He will often gnaw his
limbs or body so as to expose and even lacerate the muscles,
driven by the pruritus, or the insatiable disposition to bite. Yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>he has still an instinct of self preservation, retiring from a light,
or blazing brand, and seeking to evade the tongs used to seize
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The eyes assume a remarkable expression. They are often
fixed, and at times the pupils are widely dilated allowing the reflection
of light from the brilliant tapetum lucidum, resembling
flashes of fire, and adding greatly to his ferocious appearance, and
the sense of terror that he inspires. The conjunctiva is congested,
of a dark red and the general expression of the eye is very striking.
The soft, trusting, affectionate eyes may still for a moment
meet those of the loved master, but there is in them a dull, hopeless,
anxious and suffering expression, which appeals for pity and
should be viewed with dread. To others there is likely to be less
of the affectionate appeal and more of the sinister, suspicious, resentful
and malicious expression. To the stranger, therefore, the
eye may be a better guide than even to the owner. Squinting of the
eyes and closure of the lids for a few seconds are not uncommon.
As the disease advances the dilatation of the pupils is more marked,
indicating the paralysis of the optic nerve.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this stage the disposition to wander is characteristic. The
rabid dog leaves his home and wanders off a long distance, say
ten or twenty miles, snapping in his travels at man or beast
that may irritate him, returns dirty and exhausted, and seeks
anew his dark place of seclusion, or he may snap at and bite even
his master. To those who come in contact with him at this time
the dog is especially dangerous from his extreme irritability though
weak and exhausted.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the wandering rabid dog meets a strange dog he attacks him
and bites without growling or barking. If the bitten dog does
not yelp nor retaliate, but simply flees, the rabid animal moves
on, but if he bites back, or howls, he worries him, rolling him
over and biting again but always in silence, in marked contrast
with an enraged but healthy dog. If he comes up with a herd of
cattle or pigs or a flock of sheep or fowls, the result is similar. If
they remain perfectly still they may possibly entirely escape, but
if they scamper off with noise as usually happens, he rushes at
them and bites one after another, so that in a confined yard or
park all may suffer. A man meeting the dog increases his danger
by making an outcry, whereas if he remains perfectly quiet he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>may possibly escape. Bouley says that a canine attendant is, in a
sense, a measure of protection to a man, as the rabid dog attacks
first the animal of his own species, giving the man a chance to
escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his wanderings the rabid dog will swim rivers, having <i>no
dread of water</i>, just as at home he will plunge his nose in water
though unable to swallow. When abroad in this way he exhausts
himself by his paroxysms and may perish in one of them, or he
may meet his death from man or animal. He may in his exhausted
state seek a dark secluded place where he may remain for a
time and renew his travel later, or he may pass into the paralytic
condition and gradually sink.</p>

<p class='c008'>When shut up, and his vagrant disposition curbed, the paroxysms
are liable to appear intermittently, a period of torpor and
quiet alternating with one of restless movement, searching, scraping,
howling, biting of any animals within reach and later of men,
beginning with strangers. A paroxysm can usually be roused by
shaking a stick at him and always by presenting another dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is sometimes a difficulty in deglutition, the dog acting
as if he had a bone in his throat which he was trying to dislodge,
and fatal bites have been sustained during well meant attempts to
remove the hypothetical bone. This bears a resemblance to the
pharyngeal spasms which are such a marked feature in the hydrophobic
man. But it is not roused, as in man, by the sight or
sound of water. On the contrary, water is sought and often
swallowed at first and even, exceptionally, throughout the disease.
He may even take his usual food for a time. The bowels are
usually torpid, and any fæces passed are black and fœtid. Diarrhœa
may set in later.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the early stages the rabid dog walks or trots like any other
dog. It is only when exhausted by wandering, or violent paroxysms,
or both, that he droops his head and ears, hangs the
tail between the legs, and slouches along with arched back, and
unsteady, swaying limbs. The appearance of these last symptoms
implies advancing debility and paresis, and the near approach
of paraplegia. The symptoms may, however, be temporarily
relieved by a period of seclusion and quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>dumb</i> or <i>paralytic rabies</i> the striking peculiarity is the omission
of the preliminary furious stage, and the disease merges at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>once into paralysis after the premonitory symptoms. In these
cases the early nervous symptoms tend to prostration, weakness
and dulness or even stupor, there is no disposition to escape, but
rather to seek seclusion and quiet, there is rarely howling and
then only at first, and soon there is paralysis of the masseters
and dropping of the lower jaw, and there is neither ability nor
desire to bite. From this the paralysis extends to the hind limbs
and then to the fore limbs and trunk. In other cases one limb
is the first to suffer, followed by the face, limbs and body. The
most prominent feature is the widely opened mouth, the flaccid,
hanging tongue and drivelling saliva. The buccal mucosa, at
first red and moist, becomes bluish, dry and powdery. The eyes
are dull, mournful, suffering or altogether without expression
and the pupils are usually widely dilated. The hind limbs are
usually utterly helpless and often the fore ones as well, the prostration
is extreme and the patient lies quiet and helpless until released
by death in two or three days.</p>

<p class='c008'>A third form, known as the <i>lethargic</i>, is a modification of the
paralytic. There may be neither delirium nor marked paralysis,
there is no drooping maxilla, pendant tongue nor stringy, hanging
saliva, but only a profound, nervous prostration and complete
apathy. The patient curls himself up in some dark, quiet corner
and cannot be roused by coaxing or punishment, by hunger or
thirst. In this, as in the dumb rabies, the common test of presenting
another dog fails to rouse excitement or paroxysm. If
left undisturbed, these patients may live to the tenth or fifteenth
day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beside the typical forms there are all intermediate grades, inclining
more or less toward the furious, or the paralytic or lethargic.
Galtier mentions cases that showed aphasia, scarcely any
disposition to bite, swaying movements of the body and limbs,
muscular incoördination, tucked up, tender abdomen, rolling the
body like a barrel, and marked dyspnœa. Others show at first a
slight disposition to bite which is quickly checked by a very early
paralysis of the masseters. In still others the attempts to bite
are still seen after dropping of the jaw, but though still moved,
it cannot be completely closed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In exceptional cases rabid dogs have shown <i>intermissions</i> of
apparent soundness extending over eight days (Youatt), two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>months (Pasteur), or even six months (Perrin). Rare as these
are they must apparently be accepted, and must qualify to some
extent the trust reposed in immunization.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> The early diagnosis of rabies in the dog is of
supreme importance as enabling the owner to destroy or seclude
the dangerous animal before he has developed the disposition to
bite and to propagate the disease. If the dog himself is known to
have been bitten, every premonitory symptom should be carefully
looked for and critically studied. Any change in the general
habit, unusual liveliness or dulness, restlessness, or somnolence,
unwonted affection or taciturnity, special watchfulness with
vision, or hearing, change in the character or tones of the
voice or the disposition to use it, propensity to swallow
foreign nonalimentary bodies, retching, vomiting or costiveness,
propensity to hide away in a dark corner or to leave
home and disappear for a day or more, disposition to gnaw
and tear up wood or clothing, or hyperæsthesia affecting any of
the senses should be carefully noted. Note especially any exaggeration
of the generative instinct, any strabismus, or redness
of the eyes, any turning of the eyes or head after imaginary
objects or snapping at them, any disposition to anger or attack
when another dog or cat is presented and any disposition to growl
at or to bite a stranger. This tendency to anger and resentment
though not always present is usually a symptom of the very
greatest value. If a dog is known to have bitten or attempted to
bite any person or animal he should be tied or shut up in a safe
place for four days at least, under veterinary supervision, and set
free only on condition that no symptoms have developed at the
end of this period. A hasty decision that a suspected dog is not
rabid must lay a veterinarian open to the most serious charges, in
case rabies occurs in man or beast from the bites.</p>

<p class='c008'>Diagnosis is less difficult after the paroxysmal stage has set in.
Then there is the extreme irritability and hyperæsthesia, the
appearance of reflex spasms of the pharyngeal muscles and chest
under the influence of any peripheral excitement, the derangement
of the senses, the dilated pupil, the flashing eye, the
squinting, the taciturnity and the propensity to bite. Later still
the lack of coördination of movement or the paralysis, especially
of the hind limbs and of the jaws.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>The symptoms may be simulated by those of some other
diseases. Thus the bitch which has been exhausted by lactation
may show delirium with taciturnity and a disposition to snap.
The dog, which is habitually struck or threatened by passers by,
may acquire a sinister look and a disposition to bite on every
occasion. The presence of a bone or other foreign body fixed
between the upper molars, and various injuries of the jaws, teeth
or throat may cause inability to swallow, change of the voice and
a morose disposition and expression. In such cases there may be
vomiting, rubbing the jaws with the paws as if to disengage
something and salivation, but there is neither delirium, fury,
muscular weakness nor paralysis. In paralytic rabies on the
other hand, along with the open mouth and drivelling saliva,
there is no disposition to paw the mouth nor face, the buccal
mucosa is not simply red but of a deep violet, and there is attendant
weakness or paralysis of the hind parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Galtier has seen inability to swallow and dropping of the lower
jaw from violent stomato-pharyngitis, and from dislocation of the
maxilla.</p>

<p class='c008'>Great tenderness of the skin from inflammation due to blistering
or caustic agents or from rheumatism may cause such alert apprehension
and disposition to bite in self defense that it may simulate
hyperæsthesia of rabies.</p>

<p class='c008'>From pharyngeal anthrax and violent angina, rabies is distinguished
by the extreme exaltation of the special senses, the
marked hyperæsthesia and reflex excitability, and, as in the
other diseases mentioned, by the perfectly lucid intermissions.
Epilepsy is not to be roused by sudden noise, movement nor
attempts to swallow, it is not associated with hyperæsthesia and
in the <i>haut mal</i> the spasms affect the muscular system more generally.
A disposition to bite, and spasms and other nervous
symptoms, resembling to some extent those of rabies, have been
seen in cases of pentastoma in the nasal sinuses, cysticercas in the
brain, filaria immitis in the blood, nematodes, and tænia in the
bowels, and auricular acariasis, but there is no such hallucination
nor visual delusion, no alteration of the voice, no cutaneous
anæsthesia, no exalted reflex excitability. Cadeac finds rabiform
symptoms with disorders of the special senses in animals dosed
with various essential oils, but the odor of these essences about the
mouth and in the breath would serve to distinguish.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span><i>Symptoms in Cats.</i> The disease makes a rapid progress, and
often ends in death in three or four days. There is a marked
change of voice, the calls being hoarse and bass, having been
compared to that of a cat in heat. As in the dog, there is a disposition
to pick up and swallow objects that are in no sense food,
perhaps even its own urine or fæces. There is a great tendency
to hide away under furniture or in secluded corners so that the
malady may be far advanced before anything is suspected. If
seen the patient shows restlessness and frequent movement, with
a marked excitability under noise or other disturbing influence.
Any disturbance may arouse a paroxysm, accompanied by occasional
wide dilatation of the pupils, with flashes from the bright
carpet in the vitreous chamber, and the patient may spring at
human beings and bite or scratch the hands, face or other uncovered
portion of the body. It shows the same disposition to
bite small animals, and especially dogs. A glairy often frothy
saliva is found in the mouth and often around the lips. As the
disease advances and paresis sets in, the cat usually crawls into
some dark secluded corner and there dies.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Solipeds.</i> These may vary much in different
cases but the leading characteristics, as seen in the dog, are
prominent also in the soliped. There is marked restlessness,
trembling, and extraordinary hyperæsthesia, as seen in starting at
sounds, sudden flashes of light or other causes of disturbance.
The ears are held erect and watchful for sounds; the eyes are red
and mostly vigilant with at times pupillary dilatation and flashing.
The sight of a dog rouses him instantly to attack it with teeth
and heels. A stranger is liable to be similarly treated though the
horse is still docile and kind to his keeper. There may be itching
of the skin and above all of the seat of the bite. During a
paroxysm the movements are usually violent, dangerous and even
mischievous. There is constant restless movement, pawing,
kicking the ground, the stall or attendants, lying down, rolling,
rising, straining to urinate, or defecate, eversion of the rectum,
shaking the head, muffled neighing, sniffing, snorting, everting
of the upper lip, grinding of the teeth, or biting. In the
absence of such paroxysms deglutition may be difficult, and the
appetite depraved, the patient preferring earth or manure to the
natural food. With spasms or paralysis of the pharynx, the food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>may be returned through the nose. In some cases a stiffness or
impaired control of the limbs has suggested inflammation of the
feet. In the uncastrated male and female generative excitement
is the rule, the protrusion and erection of the penis, the swelling
and rigidity of the clitoris, with frequent straining to pass water,
the whinnying of the animal for its mate; attempts at copulation
and even ejection of semen may be observed. The seat of the
bite may be red, angry and itchy, so that the horse rubs, nibbles
or gnaws it, often breaking it open anew. There is usually
ardent thirst, and no dread of water, even when swallowing is
difficult or impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>During a violent paroxysm the horse often bites the halter,
blanket, manger, rack or stall, seizes the adjoining horse with
his teeth, or gnaws, or tears strips of skin from his own shoulder,
breast or limbs. In the same way he uses his feet with the most
evident purpose of injuring man or beast that may approach him,
or he breaks down his stall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even at an early stage there may be spasmodic movements of
the eyes, face or body, and later there appear signs of paresis,
often commencing in a hind limb and extending to paraplegia and
general paralysis. Sometimes paralysis begins in the muscles
adjoining the seat of the bite. The temperature, at first normal,
may rise to 104° F. in the advanced stages, breathing and pulse
are greatly accelerated, and the skin may be bathed in perspiration.
Spasms are not entirely superseded by paralysis, and death
often takes place during a convulsion, from the fourth to the
sixth day. In apoplexy death may ensue in one day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cases in which paralysis is not preceded by a furious stage are
not uncommon in horses.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Cattle.</i> Cattle are frequent victims of rabies,
which assumes mostly the furious type, yet in certain outbreaks
the paralytic or lethargic form predominates. There is first a
strange irritability and restlessness, very unlike the habitual
quiet disposition of the animal. The head is raised, the ears
alert, the eyes prominent, red, fixed, with occasionally widely
dilated pupils and brilliant flashes from the tapetum lucidum.
Sometimes they roll or squint. They may appear wild and ferocious
or dull and hopeless. Loud and terrified bellowing is not
uncommon, switching of the tail, drivelling of saliva, and exceptionally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>there are attempts to bite. More commonly the
natural weapons of offense are employed, the animal kicks,
stamps, paws and, above all, tries to gore man or beast, but especially
any dog which may appear. They even make such attacks
on purely imaginary beings and without any real, tangible
enemy present. The bull, cow or heifer present the usual signs
of genital orgasm. Appetite is lost or depraved and rumination
arrested. Pharyngeal spasms or paralysis is not uncommon,
and signs of colic with frequent defecation may be seen. Violent
paroxysms are easily roused by the sight of a small animal and
especially of a dog. In these attacks the animal may break his
horns or teeth or otherwise injure himself. Sometimes the infection
wound becomes irritable, itchy and red or even abraded and
raw by licking.</p>

<p class='c008'>The animal becomes rapidly exhausted and even emaciated by
the violence of the paroxysms, and paresis sets in with dragging
movements of the hind limbs, which advance to paraplegia and
general paralysis. Rolling of the eyes, squinting and pupillar
dilatation may be present. Death usually takes place from the
fourth to the sixth day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The purely <i>paralytic rabies</i> is not uncommon in cattle. There
may be persistent yawning or other sign of nervous exhaustion
or depression, halting on one or more limbs, usually behind,
which advances to complete paralysis. In other cases the symptoms
are those of mental dulness, and profound lethargy with
gradually advancing emaciation. In paretic and paralytic cases
the characteristic paroxysms on presentation of a dog may be
absent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ladague claims to have seen intermittent cases with an interval
of 27 and even 36 days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Sheep and Goat.</i> In these there is the same
regular succession of symptoms through intense hyperæsthesia
and excitability, fury and genital excitement to the terminal
paralysis, or the palsy may set in early without premonitory
violence. Among the marked features have been noticed, a
change of expression, the pupils dilate, eyes flash, they lick or
mount their fellows, they lick or rub the bitten part, snort, stamp
or scrape with the fore feet, setting themselves in the attitude of
attack, they may butt other sheep, fowls, and other animals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>above all dogs, or they may deliver the attack in the air only, at
some phantom enemy. They may bleat hoarsely or brokenly,
grind the teeth, or work the jaws with the formation of froth
about the lips. Galtier says they may even attempt to bite.
Sooner or later weakness of the limbs, muscular incoördination,
swaying and staggering bespeak enervation, the sheep lies constantly,
and if raised stands with unsteady semi-flexed limbs, has
trembling or convulsions and dies paralytic in from two to five
days. Death has been delayed till the twelfth day (goat) or
thirteenth (sheep). In some cases paralysis has been present
from the start, the subject lying prostrate from the first.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Rabies in the Camel and Deer.</i> In Algiers camels are often
times bitten by rabid dogs and contract the disease showing both
furious and paralytic symptoms. They are especially dangerous
because of their propensity to bite, and to scatter the virulent
product by sneezing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In England rabies has prevailed extensively in parks of deer,
which shut inside high walls have been bitten remorselessly by rabid
dogs that had gained admittance. The symptoms of hyperæsthesia
and paralysis followed the same general course as in other
animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Swine.</i> Rabid pigs are usually very restless, excitable
and sensitive to all causes of disturbance. They will hide
under the litter in the darkest corner but soon start without apparent
cause, turn around and lie down again, or they bound up
with grunt or scream and rush off as if pursued, push or leap
against the wall, stand with ears pricked as if listening, and start
violently at any noise or a flash from a lantern, trembling, squealing,
or having muscular jerking. The eyes are at times fixed, or
may roll, squint or flash from pupillary dilatation. The voice is
hoarse, deglutition difficult, there is frequent clenching of the
jaws, or grinding of the teeth, and frothing around the mouth.
The victim may tear with his teeth the boards of his pen, or
gnaw pieces of wood, he may swallow wood, pebbles or earth,
and plunge his face in water or other liquid without fear or apparent
dread or dislike. The disposition to bite may be viciously
shown, and he may strike dangerously with his tusks, while in
other cases it may be entirely absent. Peuch quotes cases in
which no paroxysm was aroused by the sight of a dog, and others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>in which the pig would rise and grunt without showing any desire
to bite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sows will sometimes bite or devour their offspring during a
paroxysm, yet nurse and care for the survivors during the
intervals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Emaciation, weakness, exhaustion, lethargy and paralysis appear
early, the victim remains down, or, if raised, moves weakly
and unsteadily and no longer pays attention to noises nor blows.
Death may ensue from the first to the sixth day.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Rabbits.</i> Experimental cases in rabbits are now
very common and usually assume the paralytic or lethargic type,
there is weakness in the hind parts, advancing in a few hours to
paraplegia, the fore limbs may be used for a time while the hind
are flaccid and dragged behind, or the animal lies on the sternum
and belly with the head sunken and resting on the feet, or he lies
extended on his side, in a state of insensibility. In the early
stages he may still masticate, with froth collecting on the lips,
but there is difficulty in swallowing. If a foot is pinched it is
drawn up often with a cry. The bowels are torpid though a few
small, round, hard pellets are sometimes passed or a little urine.
Incubation is shorter than in the dog, and the virus retains this
habit when inoculated on other animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the experimental cases in the Anti-rabic Institute in
St. Petersburg, Helman found that the rabbits inoculated with
virus from dogs having furious rabies, contracted furious rabies,
while those inoculated from the less furious type of street rabies
had the disease in the dumb form.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in the Guinea-pig.</i> In this animal as in the rabbit
the disease has been mainly seen in the experimental form, and
has assumed the paralytic type. It trembles, moves stiffly or
weakly, lies most of its time and passes rapidly into paralysis.
There is usually no tendency to bite, yet Peuch in a case of intraocular
inoculation from a rabid cat observed the most violent excitement,
loud hoarse screaming, bounding in different directions,
biting of the wires of the cage, and other manifestations of violent
rabies. In both forms there are liable to be convulsive movements
of the jaws, accumulation of frothy saliva, and a free discharge
of urine.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Birds.</i> Chickens bitten by mad dogs have been
seen to prove restless, erecting the feathers and moving aggressively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>toward man or dog or phantoms of their imagination and attacking
with bill or spurs or both. This, however, rapidly advances to
paralysis and death. In cases due to intracranial inoculation on
the other hand, somnolence, lethargy, or coma appeared early, and
was quickly followed by paralysis. This affects especially the
legs and neck. Recoveries are common and the animal is thereafter
immune. Subsidence, with complete intermission of symptoms,
is more common than in rabbits, the disease reappearing
later, and perhaps finally ending in recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Wild Carnivora.</i> The rabid wolf, fox, jackal,
hyena, coyote, ferret, polecat and skunk lose their fear of man,
and approach and attack him either in field, village or city. The
disease has its furious and paralytic stages as in the dog, and the
animals attack according to their nature, wolves being dangerous
from flying at the face and throat, and skunks from stealing up
and biting without warning.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i> After the period of incubation prodromata
may be present, or there may be suddenly and without any premonition,
violent spasms of the pharynx and inability to swallow.
The premonitory symptoms when present consist in irritability of
the cicatrix which becomes red or blue, swollen, itchy or pricking,
and an aura or shooting pain may extend from this toward the
heart. There is anxiety, sighing, tremor, restlessness impelling
to frequent change of place, insomnia, disagreeable or painful
dreams, weariness, and gloomy forebodings. The face is pale
and drawn, and the eyes wander or have a look of apprehension.
There is some fever and often marked thirst, and the attempt to
swallow rouses slight spasm or a sensation of tightness in the
throat. The fauces, pharynx and eyes are congested, reddened
and it may be swollen. Pulse and respiration are both quickened,
the inspiration being often prolonged and sighing, and the expiration
sobbing. At first the intellect is unimpaired; there is no
illusion nor hallucination.</p>

<p class='c008'>In cases in which premonitory symptoms are lacking, violent
spasms of the throat and chest are commonly roused by an attempt
to drink and this is so painful that the patient cannot again be
induced to try. After this any suggestion of drinking, the offer
of drink, the noise of trickling water, the sight of water, the sight
of a vessel in which the water was contained, or even of a clear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>shining surface of glass or metal is likely to bring on a paroxysm.
This hydrophobia is peculiar to man being rarely seen in rabid
animals. During a paroxysm dyspnœa is extreme, respiration is
gasping or sighing, and in the attempt to dislodge the tenacious
mucus which is present in the throat, hoarse or shrill inarticulate
sounds are emitted which have been supposed to resemble the
bark of the dog. There is a sense of closure of the throat and of
rising of the stomach, and retching or even vomiting may ensue.
Hyperæsthesia, reflex irritability, and exaltation of the special
senses, now become extreme, so that a paroxysm may be brought
on by the slightest disturbance, a current of air, a bright light,
the rustling of a dress, the noise of a footfall, the noise even of
talking, or a slight touch. The “tendon reflex” and skin
reflex are often much encreased. During a paroxysm there are
muscular trembling and clonic spasms,—sometimes opisthotonos.
The intervals of complete relaxation, however, serve to distinguish
from tetanus. The face is red and drawn, the eyes congested
and sometimes squinting, the pupils dilated and the
expression one of suffering, apprehension and horror. Mental
disorder appears sooner or later, the speech is disconnected, with
indication of delusions from which the patient may at first be
recalled by the attendant. There is, however, a constant disposition
to be reticent, morose and above all, suspicious, as shown by
the absence of a direct look, and the frequency of side glances as
though in expectation of a hidden danger. This may even rise
to mania, the patient charges those about him with having caused
his sufferings, or with conspiracy to injure him, and he may seek
to defend himself with hands, feet, teeth or any available object.
The necessary restraint aggravates and prolongs the attack. On
its subsidence the patient collects his scattered senses, regrets,
apologizes, and warns against future occurrences of the same
kind which he realizes to be beyond his control. Sometimes the
delusions continue during the remission as well. Sexual excitement
is common in man as in animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>The convulsive paroxysms may last ½ to 1 hour, and they
tend to encrease in duration and force. A violent paroxysm
may cause sudden death from asphyxia or apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sooner or later exhaustion and paresis appear. The convulsions
become gradually weaker, the reflex irritability and hyperæsthesia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>abate, and the patient may become once more able to
swallow, but an ascending paralysis, beginning in the limbs
spreads over the body and death occurs in from one to eighteen
hours. In the paralytic stage there may still be slight jerking of
the muscles, or tremors, but violent convulsion no longer occurs,
and there is extreme prostration, with hurried, rattling breathing,
small, weak, irregular pulse and finally, stupor and coma.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis in man.</i> The only additional point, to those already
stated for animals, is in regard to <i>lyssophobia</i>. This false form of
hydrophobia is usually fortified by the fact of a bite, but as a
rule it lacks the exaltation of common sensation and of the special
senses which characterizes genuine hydrophobia. Very often also
there is a flaw in the history, the dog that inflicted the bite is unknown
and may still be alive, in which case no medicine is so
good as to bring the healthy dog into the presence of the patient.
The dog may have been killed by an excited community without
any identification of his symptoms as those of rabies or any post
mortem examination to throw light on his case. The attack
may have come on after a conversation on the subject of the bite,
or of rabies, and perhaps, as in the case of the Montpellier cadet,
long after and when the patient had for the first time heard that
the dog that bit him had been mad. It may be that rabies does
not exist in the district and that no other victim in man nor beast
can be adduced. It may be that the patient has a nervous organization
or is subject to hysteria, and therefore specially predisposed
to any disease of the imagination. Such cases cannot
be accepted as rabies until a successful inoculation has been made
on one or more animals.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>RABIES AND HYDROPHOBIA. LESIONS. TREATMENT AND PREVENTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lesions: blood fluid or clot diffluent. Fauces, pharynx and larynx congested,
exceptionally ulcerated. In dog, mouth cyanotic, with tenacious
mucus, sublingual petechiæ and erosions, stomach contains many foreign
bodies, but no food, small intestines and cæcum empty, and like stomach
congested: petechiæ on skin and elsewhere, cutaneous and cardiac veins
gorged, hyperæmic liver, kidneys and bladder: brain congested, capillaries
dilated or blocked, hæmorrhagic, leucocytic collections in lymph spaces,
nerve cells swell up with hyaline bodies near nuclei, and neuroglia has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>hyperplasia, especially near the respiratory centre. Congestion of nerves.
Leucocytosis. Therapeutic treatment: Orrotherapy: of little avail.
Nerve sedatives; darkness, quiet, nutritive enemata, chloroform, chloral,
etc. Prevention: eradicate the virus; muzzle all dogs absolutely, under
heavy penalty, for one year; Gower’s view; examples of muzzling; collar
with name and owner, shoot all unmuzzled dogs, cage for 6 months bitten
dogs and cats, also all imported dogs, shut up in cage for 10 days all dogs
that have bitten; treatment of bites, tourniquet, cup, suck through tube,
wring wound, cauterize—hot skewer, cautery, mineral solid caustic, mineral
acids on pledget or through a tube; Pasteur method: emulsion of
spinal cord (of rabid rabbit) after aseptic æration in vitro for 3 to 14 days,
injected in graduated doses for 21 days, table of doses, table of mortality;
Orrotherapy: by blood serum of immune animal: advantages, disadvantages—technique:
Use of sterilized brain matter from rabid animal: experiments;
protection by snake venom.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Pathological Anatomy.</i> The blood is fluid or the clot diffluent.
Congestion of the fauces, pharynx and larynx is patent during
life but may have disappeared after death. Yet I have seen extensive
ulceration of the vocal cords in a rabid cow. The congestion
may extend to the trachea bronchia and lungs. In <i>dogs</i>
the buccal mucosa is often cyanotic, covered with a thick mucus,
and may present sublingual ecchymoses and erosions, and wounds
of various kinds made by objects bitten or swallowed. The stomach
in the same animal is usually almost pathognomonic, being
filled with foreign bodies of all kinds—straw, hay, hair, wood,
coal, pebbles, pieces of metal, cord, leather, cloth, earth, sand,
etc.—the result of the depraved appetite. There is an absence of
normal food principles in stomach and small intestines and the
cæcum and colon are usually empty. The gastric mucosa is congested,
and may be wounded and its contents mixed with blood.
Such a condition of the stomach in a dog, that has been bitten,
and which after a customary incubation period has shown symptoms
like those of rabies, is virtually diagnostic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following lesions are common to man and animals: Marked
emaciation, cyanosis or petechiæ in skins that are naturally white,
early sepsis, cutaneous veins and heart gorged with dark
inspissated blood, hyperæmic liver and kidneys, and slightly congested,
petechiated empty bladder.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most important lesions, however are those of the central
nervous system. In seven cases out of nine, Gowers found these
very distinct. There were vascular disturbance, capillary dilatation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>capillary clots, minute hæmorrhages, and accumulations
around the affected capillaries of leucocytes occupying the lymph
spaces. Benedikt and Babes attach much importance to the formation
of hyaline patches in the thickened walls of the vessels
and around them, compressing the vessels in some cases to virtual
obliteration. The nerve cells swell up, and show small hyaline
bodies in the vicinity of the nuclei, and these latter finally disappear.
Germano and Capobianco found in addition marked hyperplasia
of the neuroglia. Babes, who looks on these changes as
pathognomonic, takes a small portion of spinal cord, hardens it in
alcohol for 24 hours, stains it with aniline red and examines for
the characteristic hyaline nodes.</p>

<p class='c008'>These brain lesions have been found mainly in the medulla near
the floor of the fourth ventricle and the respiratory center, but
they are also to be found in other parts of the encephalon and
spinal cord. The greater constancy of the medullary lesions
serves to explain the characteristic symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Congestions of the peripheral nerves have also been found.
Lüttkemüller found in rabies a moderate increase of the white
blood corpuscles and a great number of microcytes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Therapeutic Treatment.</i> It was long thought that rabies was
necessarily fatal, as indeed nearly all developed cases are to the
present day. For this reason and much more on account of the
risk of preservation and propagation of the deadly germ, the attempts
at curative treatment in the lower animals have been looked
on as utterly unwarranted or absolutely criminal. Yet it is now
known that very exceptionally a recovery takes place, and in that
case immunity for the future may be counted on. Yet the frightful
danger attendant on the preservation and treatment of a rabid
animal, may well forbid the keeping of any of the lower animals
affected by rabies unless it be in the safest seclusion and for the
production of immunizing or curative products.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Orrotherapy</i> with the blood serum of an immunized animal
is of little value, and attended by risk from the rabid animal, but
will be noticed below as a prophylactic.</p>

<p class='c008'>In man when the disease is manifested, palliation has been obtained
and very exceptionally recovery, under darkness, quiet,
nutritious enemata and antispasmodics or soporifics. Among such
antispasmodics and nerve sedatives may be named chloroform,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>chloral, curare (3 alleged recoveries), eserine (1 recovery), pilocarpin
(1 recovery), morphia, datura, atropia, and bromide of
potassium. Others have recovered without any medicinal treatment,
so that the mildness of the attack must be duly considered
in every case.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prophylaxis.</i> The most effective way of preventing rabies is
to eradicate the virus from the country. All immunizing
measures resorted to after the infecting bite has been sustained,
are of little value as compared with this, they may save the bitten
individual, but they do nothing to prevent others from being
bitten in the future, and indirectly they contribute to the maintenance
of the disease by drawing attention from such radical
measures as would rid the country forever of the scourge. In
his great work on Diseases of the Nervous System, Gowers puts
this not a whit too strongly when he says: “The enforced muzzling
of dogs for a period of one year would almost certainly
stamp out the disease. That such a measure is not adopted is a
national disgrace, which is accentuated by the fact that the
Government derives part of its revenue from a tax upon dogs.
The opposition to the use of the muzzle is one of the strangest
developments of morbid sentiment. There are apparently
thousands of well-meaning people who would prefer that hundreds
of dogs should perish every year of a painful disease, that many
human lives should be annually lost, and scores of persons
should be subjected for months to acute mental agony—rather
than that dogs should be made to wear an apparatus which causes
them a trifling annoyance. This perverted sentiment ought to
be met with universal abhorrence as a disgrace to humanity.”
Such a statute, backed by a penalty in some degree commensurate
to the homicidal criminality of the person who would leave his
dog free to inflict this horrible disease on humanity would doubtless
be effectual, but some nations have such laws on their statute
books, and yet allow them to become dead letters. Others have
enforced them to good purpose. Berlin in 1853 had many cases
of rabies and muzzling was enforced. In three years the disease
was completely eradicated and the city enjoyed nine years of immunity
or so long as the law was enforced. Similar successes
were met with in Holland, new cases occurring only on the
borders or in imported dogs. London in 1889 had 123 cases and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>muzzling was enjoined. In 1892 the cases were reduced to 3,
and the muzzling law was suspended, and a steady yearly encrease
resulted, until the 1st three months of 1896 furnished as
many as 72 cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the absence of this radical measure muzzling should be enforced
for a year in any locality where a case of rabies has occurred,
and every dog should wear a collar with the name and
residence of his owner inscribed on it. All stray dogs and all
unmuzzled ones should be summarily shot. Dogs and cats that
have been bitten by rabid animals should be destroyed or shut up
in cages for six months under veterinary supervision. Imported
dogs should be similarly secluded. Dogs that have bitten animals
or men should be shut up for ten days under supervision, when,
if rabid, the animal will develop unequivocal symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment of bites.</i> Absorption from a wound in a limb may
be prevented by applying a tourniquet. Wounds on the body
may be cupped, or sucked through a tube. Or the wound may
be wrung to encrease the flow of blood. As soon as possible it
should be thoroughly cauterized. A hot skewer, a Paquelin
cautery, a stick of silver nitrate or zinc chloride or caustic potash
or a crystal of cupric sulphate will meet this end. If liquid
caustics are to be employed they can be applied to all parts of the
wound by means of a pipette, a glass tube, or swab.</p>

<p class='c008'>With thorough cauterization shortly after the bite there is
practically nothing to fear, and even if it has not been applied
for hours after, it is still valuable in destroying the poison left in
the wound from which a continuous infection of the brain, by
the transmission of the unknown germ and its toxins, would
otherwise take place. It has besides in the human being a good
moral effect against lyssophobia by giving the bitten person a
certain sense of protection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The Pasteur Method.</i> This is based on the fact that the spinal
cord of the tetanic rabbit when removed aseptically, and kept <i>in
vitro</i> in a dry atmosphere, loses in virulence day by day, until on
the fourteenth day it is harmless. To render the air more drying,
caustic potash is introduced into the flask. The culture of the
poison in rabbits intensifies its virulence, until the virus becomes
the strongest known and when inoculated subdurally, reduces
the incubation to six or seven days.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>In Pasteur’s early experiments he began injecting the emulsion
of the cord desiccated for 14 days, following with that of the 13th
day, and so on to that of the 5th. It was soon found that this
was comparatively ineffective when inoculation had been made
with a strong virus or in a large dose, and the treatment for such
cases was modified to what is now known as the intensive method.
The weaker forms of the virus are given at shorter intervals on
the first days of treatment, and the stronger forms repeated again
and again, and, in place of a 15 days, course of treatment, this is
extended to 21 days. The following table illustrates the course:</p>

<p class='c008'>Under this treatment the system becomes educated in the production
of antitoxins, and perhaps also in phagocytosis so that
when subjected to the lethal doses of three, four, five and six
days preservation, it successfully resists them. The most conclusive
argument in favor of its efficacy is this undeniable fact
that the individual escapes death under injected doses which in
any unprotected system would prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Pasteur treatment by its great success in persons who have
already been bitten has in a great measure robbed hydrophobia of
its terrors, only it must be resorted to as early as possible in the
period of incubation. It has also been advocated as a means of
immunizing subjects that have not been bitten but are more or less
liable to be so, and on this basis a large number of dogs have been
passed through it. This is not likely to be adopted in the case of
the human being, the more so that a few, although on the whole
a very limited number of persons, have developed rabies long
after the taking of the Pasteur treatment. This has been attributed
to the retention of latent germs in the system, and argues
besides a remaining susceptibility to the poison.</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of its brilliant success and the great boon it has been
to humanity, the Pasteur treatment is not an ideal one. Its success
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>does not consist in an entire extinction of rabies, but merely
in the reducing of its evil results; its success is indeed based on
a preservation and propagation of the germ and a continuous
danger of infection of new subjects; finally, the proposition to
end the disease by passing the whole canine race through the
treatment, is open to the objections that this would require a
fabulous outlay, and that even then some rare cases are not
found to be fully protected. To continue the disease, when it
may be exterminated, and to palliate its results by the treatment
of generation after generation of dogs, must be promptly condemned
by the political economist, to say nothing of the consideration
of probable human infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Orrotherapy.</i> It is not surprising that essays were made in
the line of serum treatment. Babes and Lepp in 1889 had some
encouraging results in transferring the blood of an immune animal
into a healthy one. But Tizzoni, Schwarz and Centanni
have especially worked out this method. These have shown that
the blood serum of immunized animals destroyed the virulence of
the rabic poison, whether mixed with it before injection, or injected
with it, or injected within twenty-four hours afterward.
A very small amount of the serum is required and though delayed
until the end of the first half of the incubation period, it is only
necessary to multiply the amount by six or eight times. In this
it has a great advantage over the antitoxin of diphtheria or tetanus,
the former of which has to be multiplied 20 to 100 times,
and the latter 1000 to 2000 times in the later stages of incubation.
Further, it is possible by drying to secure the serum in a permanent
form which will remain active for a length of time if secluded
from air and light.</p>

<p class='c008'>This has the decided advantages over the Pasteur treatment,
(1) that it employs the antitoxin already formed instead of waiting
for its formation in the body of the subject injected with the
attenuated virus, and (2) that it does not introduce into the
system a virulent germ capable of propagating in a favorable
medium, but only an agent which is antidotal to that germ.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has the disadvantage as compared with Pasteur’s method
that its action is purely therapeutic in the sense of acting as an
antidote, while it produces no permanent immunity. It does not
like the toxins educate the cells to produce an encrease of antitoxin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>and it can only protect so long as it remains in the system.
Whenever it is eliminated or destroyed, the susceptibility to
rabies returns. Hence it is important to continue its administration
as long as the microbe remains in the system. As in tetanus
and diphtheria antitoxin treatment, it is also important to destroy
the microbe and its toxins in the infection wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>The animal which is to furnish the antitoxin is immunized as
in the Pasteur method by a succession of graduated doses of rabic
virus. After a treatment of 20 days the rabbit or sheep furnishes
a serum which is protective when injected in the proportion of 1
of serum to 25,000 of body weight, even though its use be delayed
until 24 hours after the introduction of the virus. The sheep can
be immunized in 12 days by doses of 0.25 gramme of emulsion of
the infected cord to every kilogramme of body weight. To maintain
the serum at its highest standard the treatment must be
repeated at intervals of 2 to 5 months, as the animal may be able
to bear it without loss of condition.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment with Sterilized Brain Matter from a Rabid Animal.</i>
In 1886 I sterilized with heat an emulsion of the spinal cord of a
man who died of hydrophobia and injected two rabbits with 3 one
drachm doses each, and a third with 4 one drachm doses on as
many successive days. These rabbits were afterwards inoculated
with virulent spinal cord and remained well for nine months,
while three control rabbits injected with virulent cord, but which
had received no previous treatment died rabid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Puscarin and Vesesco have shown that the virus is rapidly
weakened by heat up to 60° C. at which point the virulence is
destroyed. It becomes easy therefore to secure in this way a
toxin uncomplicated by any living microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Theoretically the sterilization and use of infecting nervous substance,
should share with the Pasteur method the advantage of
the selective action of the medullary matter in uniting with the
toxins and robbing them to a greater or less extent of their
toxicity. It has the additional recommendation that it introduces
no living germ, and thus obviates any possible danger of the
propagation of disease through the animal operated on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fernandez claims an immunity from rabies for dogs that have
survived the bite of a viper. Many facts and experiments are
adduced in support of this.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Lockjaw. Trismus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An infectious disease of animals and man, characterized
by tonic spasms of the voluntary muscles in a given region
or more generally, with exacerbations, and dependent on the
bacillus tetani.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> Immunity cannot be claimed for any
class of warm blooded animal. Experimentally the dog and
chicken prove among the most refractory, in keeping with the
comparative insusceptibility of the last named animal to strychnia,
but neither can be held to be in any sense immune. Inoculated
frogs become tetanic if the temperature is maintained above the
normal standard. In 208 cases in domestic animals recorded by
Cadiot and Hoffmann, 140 were in horses, 10 in mules, 5 in asses,
(solipeds, 155), 28 in cattle, 9 in sheep, 5 in goats, 5 in pigs, and 6
in dogs. Such statistics are liable to prove misleading when we
have no means of comparing them with the members of the
different genera from which the cases were drawn and the relative
exposure of each genus to traumatic lesions (infection atria).
Solipeds lead with practically ⅔ds of the entire number of cases,
but these were presumably the most numerous of the domestic
animals, and preëminently the work animals and therefore the
most liable to traumatism. Cattle follow with ⅐th of all cases
but here again the large numbers to be drawn upon, and the proportion
of work oxen and wounds, are to be considered. The
omnivora and carnivora are comparatively little susceptible and
among these the chicken may be included. The omnivorous rat
is quite susceptible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tetanus occurs in 1 per 1000 sick horses in the Prussian army
(Friedberger and Fröhner), and in 1 per 3000 sick in that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Wurtenburg (Hering). It is so prevalent in San Domingo that
a gelding costs twice as much as a stallion (Wagenfeld). Heat
and filth favor its preservation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In man tetanus is most frequent as the result of wounds (in
feet and hands) which are most likely to come in contact with the
soil, and it has visibly decreased in connection with the general
adoption of antiseptic surgery.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathology and Etiology.</i> Sir James Simpson suggested in 1854
that puerperal and surgical tetanus was due to the absorption of a
poison produced in the wound (Woodhead). Spinola charged it
on infection in wounds in horses. Carle and Rattone in 1884
successfully inoculated 11 out of 12 rabbits with the products
from the wound of a man suffering from tetanus. A year later
Nicolaier produced tetanus in animals by inoculating them subcutem
with garden mould or street dust, and found in the suppurating
wounds in connection with various other microbes a minute
bacillus longer but thinner than that of mouse septicæmia to
which he attributed the tetanizing action. In 1886 Rosenbach
inoculated two Guinea pigs with the pus of a tetanic man, and
found in the sores of the tetanic pigs the bacillus of Nicolaier in
company with another larger spore-forming bacillus. In 1889
Kitasato succeeded in making pure cultures of the bacillus tetani,
and successfully inoculated the disease on mice, rabbits, and
Guinea pigs producing typical tetanic symptoms and death. This
was promptly corroborated by Tizzoni and Cattani and later by a
great variety of observers.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacillus Tetani.</i> This organism is a minute rod 4 to 5μ in
length by 0.2 to 0.3μ in thickness, with slightly rounded ends.
In many mature forms the one end is enlarged by the formation
of a spherical, refrangent spore which gives the bacillus the
appearance of a pin or a “drum-stick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacillus is anærobic, liquefying, tardily motile, and sporogenous.
When spores form the bacillus loses its motility. It
grows at room temperatures, in ordinary culture media which
have a feebly alkaline reaction, and in an atmosphere of hydrogen,
but more actively at a temperature of 36° to 38° C. Below 14° C.
growth ceases and the bacillus is killed at 60° to 65° C. The
spores, however, can resist a temperature of 80° C., in water for
an hour, and 100° C. for four minutes. It was this unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>resistance of the spore to heat that enabled Kitasato to kill off the
contaminating organisms and obtain pure cultures from the surviving
spores. The spores will survive desiccation for years,
retaining their virulence, and may live 2½ months in putrefying
material. The addition to the culture medium of 1½ to 2 per
cent. of glucose makes the growth much more rapid and abundant,
and causes opacity in the medium. The upper portion clears up
in 6 or 7 days by the precipitation of the bacilli as a grayish mass.
In a glucose culture medium growth is not prevented by the presence
of oxygen at the surface. The colonies formed in gelatine
plate cultures show an opaque centre with fine divergent rays, and
a similar radiating growth is shown in deep stick cultures. At
the end of the second week the gelatine begins to liquefy and form
a little gas, and finally the whole mass becomes soft and sticky.
The bacillus does not liquefy blood serum. Cultures have a disagreeable
aromatic odor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bacilli stain readily in aniline colors and by Gram’s
method. The spores may be stained by Ziehl’s method. To 10
parts of a 10 per cent. alcoholic solution of basic fuchsin, add 100
parts of a watery solution of carbolic acid. Float the cover glass
upon this, heating gently for three to five minutes until steam
begins to rise, wash well in water, and decolorize in nitric or sulphuric
acid, 25 per cent. solution, then in 60 per cent. alcohol to
remove color from albuminous background. Wash in water and
mount. By placing the specimen for two minutes in a watery
solution of methylene blue a contrast is obtained, the bacillus blue
and the spore red.</p>

<p class='c008'>Outside the animal body the bacillus has a saprophytic life in
rich garden mould, street dust, stables, yards and drains, and the
cracks of floors. Nicolaier failed to obtain it in soil from forests
and from the deeper layers of garden earth. Marchesi found it
to a depth of two metres but no more. Again it is much more
abundant in tropical countries than in temperate and cold ones,
and appears to be to a great extent limited to particular localities.
It has been found in the intestinal contents of man and horse
(Babes, Sormani), and in horse manure, and this mingling with
the surface soil and generating an abundance of ammonia determines
the anærobic conditions which favor the growth of the
microbe. This serves to explain the remarkable prevalence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the disease among those living or working about stables, gardeners,
agricultural laborers, soldiers on campaign, and children
and others walking with bare feet. The contact with rich
infected soil greatly favors inoculation in any accidental wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>An important feature in the pathology of tetanus is that the
bacillus is confined to the seat of the inoculation wound. The
many attempts to transmit the infection by blood, nervous matter,
and by one or other of the tissues have uniformly failed, though
the pus of the infected wound has proved virulent. Similarly,
the attempts of Kitasato and others to obtain cultures from the
animal liquids or tissues apart from the wound have been futile.</p>

<p class='c008'>By inoculating the toxins remaining in the pus of the infection
wound, however, or in virulent cultures from which the bacilli
have been removed by filtration or in which they have been destroyed
by heat, all the symptoms of tetanus can be produced
(Kitasato, Kund Faber, etc.) In such cases too, the symptoms
appear at once, as soon as the toxin is absorbed, and not after a
definite period of incubation as in inoculation of the unaltered
virus. Kitasato, Vaillard and Vincent reached this conclusion
by another channel. They inoculated mice at the root of the tail
with virulent tetanus cultures, and at definite intervals after,
namely, half an hour, one hour, and one and a half hour, they
made a circular incision round the wound and thoroughly cauterized
the whole, thus destroying all the inoculated bacilli. They
found that tetanus was prevented in those animals only which
were operated on at the first half hour. Again, Kitasato injected
mice with 0.2 to 0.3cc. of the blood from the heart of a fresh
tetanus cadaver, and thereby produced typical tetanic symptoms
and death in 1 to 3 days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Various poisons have been separated from cultures of bacillus
tetani. Brieger isolated three substances—tetanin, tetano-toxin
and spasmotoxin—which in large doses caused tetanic symptoms
and even death. Brieger and Fränkel later isolated a toxalbumin
which proved of incomparably greater potency. Again, Brieger,
Kitasato and Wehl separated what appeared to be an enzyme or
diastase which proved 500 times more potent than atropia. This
was in the form of yellow, transparent flakes, soluble in water,
but which was not destroyed by drying, nor in the dry state by absolute
alcohol, chloroform nor anhydrous ether, but which, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the virulent cultures of tetanus, was easily destroyed by acids,
alkalies, hydrogen sulphide, or heat. Like the natural virulent
product this may be kept unchanged for months on ice, apart
from the light, or with the addition of 0.5 per cent. of carbolic
acid, or its own bulk of glycerine. It kills the Guinea-pig in a
dose of 0.000025 gramme, and the mouse in a dose of 0.00000025
gramme.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the propagation of the bacillus in the animal body appears
to be local, and the general tetanic symptoms are caused
by the absorption of the poison, it remains to be seen on what
organ this directly operates, and what accessory conditions favor
its efficiency.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>cases due to inoculation</i> the spasms are at first local in the
vicinity of the inoculation wound and later become general.
Kund Faber shows that there is no gradual transition from the
local manifestations to the general, but the latter appear abruptly
and in force as a new and independent phenomenon. When we
consider further that in inoculation with pure cultures (uncontamininated
by pus or saprophytic microbes) the wound often heals
promptly, without any sign of remaining local irritation, we may
conclude that simple nervous irritation in the sore cannot be invoked
as a cause of the early local spasm. It is more likely due
to the local diffusion of the poison into the peripheral nerves while
the little that has been absorbed is as yet too much diluted in
lymph and blood to seriously derange the nerve centres.</p>

<p class='c008'>When general spasms set in it must be assumed that the poison
has reached the nerve centres in toxic quantities, either through
the circulation or as is alleged by Babes and others through the
nerve trunks. When the poison is injected intravenously the
general spasms are the first to appear. Again the section of the
nerves of a limb before inoculation prevents spasms in its peripheral
muscles when all the body beside has become tetanic
(Tizzoni and Vaillard). The removal of the brain from a tetanized
frog had no effect, while the removal of a portion of the
spinal cord abolished the spasms in the muscles corresponding to
that part. Moreover Gumbrecht cut the whole of the sensory
nerves of a limb but the spasms occurred in its muscles notwithstanding.
It must be admitted, therefore, that the general tetanic
spasms are induced by disorder caused by the poison in the spinal
nervous centres.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Gumprecht and Goldscheider claim that the poison reaches the
spinal centres by way of the nerve trunks basing the conclusion
on the observation that the spasms sometimes remain for a time
more marked on that side of the body on which the wound or inoculation
was made. Absorption through the circulation also is
conceded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Courmont and Doyon claim that the product of the bacillus
tetani only operates as a ferment, which produces in the blood
the real tetanizing agent, basing the conclusion on an apparent
delay in its action, in man, as compared with strychnia, and on
the prompt action of the injected blood of a tetanic animal in
which this poison is presumably preformed. It should be noted,
however, that the disease in man is only seen after accidental inoculation
of the bacillus, and that time must be allowed for the
increase of the microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vaillard and Vincent have shown that the promptitude and
certainty of the result depend on the age of the culture employed.
A culture of 5 days in bouillon at 20° to 22° C. will not harm a
Guinea pig in a hypodermic dose of 0.25cc. to 0.5cc. A culture
of 20 days old is deadly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The action on the nerve cell of the spinal cord has been investigated
by Goldscheider and Flatau, who found degeneration of
the chromatin granules within a short time after inoculation.
(Centr. für Allg. Path. Anat. 1897). W. K. Hunter found that
the ganglion cell stained more diffusely than normal cells. There
were also some capillary dilatation and punctiform hæmorrhages
in certain cases (Brit. Med. Jour. 1897).</p>

<p class='c008'>Péchoutre examined the lumbar enlargement of tetanic rabbits,
by Nissl’s method and found the following lesions in the motor
cells of the anterior horns: 1st. A partial or total disappearance
of the distinct outer marginal line; enlargement of the cell and
pericellular space; diffuse coloration of the achromatic substance;
a disappearance of the regular concentric disposition of the granules
of Nissl which were in part reduced to a fine powder; 2d.
Encrease of nucleus and nucleolus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Others have observed encrease of the cerebro-spinal fluid,
thickening of the ependyma, nuclear proliferation in the neuroglia,
and softening of the cord, but in many cases no appreciable
lesions in the nerve centres have been found, and none can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>affirmed as constant. Neuritis in the region of the wound is
sometimes found especially if the lesion is a contused or painful
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>The muscles often show lesions the result of the violent contractions.
There may be points of ecchymosis and partial rupture
of individual fibres, they may be of a deep red, or again
pale, soft and as if parboiled. There may be hyperæmia or
œdema of the lungs, congestion of the larynx, ecchymosis on the
pericardium and other serous and mucous membranes, and congestion
of the liver, spleen and kidneys. Rigor mortis sets in
rapidly and is usually very persistent. The muscles contain an
excess of lactic acid.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> Whatever contributes to traumas must be
classed in this list. Solipeds, work oxen, and dogs are especially
exposed in this sense. In all animals castration wounds; in
horses and lambs amputation of the tail; in solipeds pricks,
bruises and fistulæ of the feet; all kinds of surgical wounds;
in females the parturient condition; and in the new born the umbilical
sore form infection atria. The tendency to infection in
wounds of the feet in animals, and of the hands and feet in man,
is easily explained by contact with the virulent earth or dust.
Children running barefoot, or injuring their bare knees and
soldiers sleeping on the ground are similarly exposed. The contamination
of the clothes is the main condition. It has been held
that infection never takes place from the gastro-intestinal canal,
but the facts that the bacillus is frequently present in the prima
viæ and that the mucosa is often perforated by blood-sucking
parasites, suggest that some cases (idiopathic) are probably
due to intestinal infection. The gland ducts also and the follicles
of Peyers’ patches and of the solitary glands offer available fields
for the colonization of the bacillus and for infection atria.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>General Symptoms in Animals.</i> In experimental cases, in
which there has been a large intravenous injection of the blood
of a victim of tetanus the symptoms may set in speedily and
violently. In casual cases, however, there is usually an <i>incubation</i>
period varying on an average from three to fifteen days in the
<i>horse</i> while it may be as short as two days in <i>cow</i> and <i>sheep</i>.
Hoffmann quotes one incubation in the horse as but six hours
after a wound in the neck, and another as twenty-five days, following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>a castration. The last is rather unreliable as infection
may have taken place long after the operation. He quotes cases
in the pig and goat, after castration as eight to fourteen days,
and one in the dog almost immediately after a bite on the loins.</p>

<p class='c008'>Following the incubation the marked phenomena are tonic contractions
of groups of muscles beginning usually with those near
to the seat of the infected wound and extending with varying rapidity
to the locomotor muscles generally (limbs, croup, back, loins,
neck, tail, abdomen) and those of mastication (jaw) and the eye.
The muscles of respiration are only involved at a late date, causing
stertorous breathing and it may be asphyxia. Peristalsis is impaired
so that there is some costiveness and tardiness in digestion.
Urination becomes difficult and infrequent on account of the
difficulty of assuming the normal position for the act, and spasm
of the sphincter vesicæ and dangerous distension of the bladder
may follow. The urine is often albuminous and has a high
density and color. Priapism is not infrequent in the male.</p>

<p class='c008'>The predominance of the spasm in special groups of muscles
has been the occasion of giving different names to individual cases.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Trismus</i> or <i>lockjaw</i> is that condition in which the muscles of
the jaws are violently contracted so that the incisors can only be
separated slightly or not at all.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Orthrotonos</i> is that condition in which the muscles in tonic
spasms keep the neck, back and loins rigid, straight and unbending,
in one horizontal line.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Opisthotonos</i> is when the muscles of the spine are in rigid
spasm, so that the back and loins are slightly depressed, the tail
elevated and trembling, the neck drawn upward with a concave
superior border (“ewed”), the head extended and the nose
elevated.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Emprosthotonos</i> is caused by spasms of the muscles of the ventral
aspect of the body, with arching of the back and tucking up of
the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pleurosthotonos</i> is when the trunk is spasmodically bent to one
side, right or left.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spasms of the muscles of the eyeball, cause sinking and
apparent diminution of that organ, with the protrusion of the
membrana nictitans over one-third, one-half or even more of its
front surface. This is often referred to by owners as “hooks”.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>More striking and pathognomonic than the above is the extreme
hyperæsthesia and irritability which rouse into activity or aggravate
the symptoms under the slightest cause of disturbance. The
effort required to feed from the ground, the stretching of himself
to urinate or defecate, the rustling of straw litter under his feet,
loud talking, or other sudden noise, banging of doors or windows,
hammering in the vicinity, a current of cold air, a flash of light,
moving the patient in the stall, attempts at mastication, simple
handling, administering medicine, or sudden jerking of the head
upward promptly brings on a paroxysm of spasm. Pushing the
head suddenly upward or jerking on the halter, is often resorted
to as a means of diagnosis, the sudden resulting rigidity of the
muscles generally, the rolling of the eye, its retraction toward the
depth of the orbit and the protrusion of the membrana nictitans
over one-half, one-third or more of the cornea, bringing out the
diagnostic symptoms in a striking manner. In very severe cases
the head may be drawn upward and backward almost to above
the loins (Henry), or one or more of the dorsal or lumbar vertebræ
may be broken or crushed (Zundel). A sudden loud noise
will sometimes cause the exhausted animal to drop to the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perspiration is not uncommon. Breathing is usually accelerated,
the encrease being in ratio with the violence of the spasms.
Pulse and temperature are usually normal at first and may be in
slight cases throughout. Even in severe cases the pulse does not
rise so much as the respiration. In violent and fatal cases
the temperature often rises excessively before death (104° to
110° F.).</p>

<p class='c008'>When the jaws are not absolutely closed, the tongue is often
wounded by the teeth, and, in any case is covered by a tenacious
mucus, which may hang in strings from the lips. If the jaws
are still movable, mastication is still carried on, but slowly, painfully
and imperfectly, and deglutition is more or less difficult.
Young animals are unable to suck.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in the horse.</i> When the symptoms are fully developed,
they are very characteristic. The neck is raised, often concave
along its upper border, the nose raised and protruded more
or less, the nostrils widely expanded, the eyes sunken, fixed and
anxious, with diluted pupils and protrusion of the haw outward
and upward from the inner canthus, the ears are pricked, rigid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>and drawn toward each other at their tips, the facial muscles
may stand out visibly and are firm, the angle of the mouth is
drawn back, the veins of the head are full and prominent, saliva
froths or drivels from the lips, the tail is elevated and during
paroxysms will tremble, and the muscles of the back and limbs
are projecting and hard. The limbs are extended outward to
give a wider base of support. If moved, the general stiffness is
at once seen. The patient cannot be turned round in his stall,
he may not even be able to turn the neck to one side, and if
backed he resists, or accomplishes the movement only with the
greatest difficulty. In walking, the limbs are used as stilts with
little or no bending of the joints, and if turned, the body is not
bent but moved around with difficulty as if one rigid mass. The
pulse is small and hard, the breathing slightly hastened, and the
mucosæ congested and reddened. The jaws may be firmly closed,
or they may still part for a time half to one inch. In all severe
cases the patient obstinately stands, and if he should drop, or lie
down, the breathing and spasms are usually encreased and, in
the efforts to rise, the respiratory muscles may become spastic
with promptly fatal results.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>cattle</i> the same general symptoms prevail. The stiffness of
neck and back, the habitual elevation of nose and tail, the stiffness
of the legs, propped outward for support, and moved like
unbending posts when made to walk, the hardness of the muscles,
standing out under the skin, the rigidity of the lips, firmly closed
or slightly opened, the general fixity of the erect, retracted ears,
and the sunken appearance of the eyes with marked protrusion
of the haw, are largely as in the horse. The muzzle is usually
dry and hot, the jaws clenched, the tongue firmly compressed
against the palate and covered with thick, tenacious mucus, and
the flanks are often flattened by the contraction of the oblique
muscles, so that they descend almost vertically from the lumbar
transverse processes. There is great difficulty in turning and
the trunk moves in rather a rigid mass without bending laterally,
and the limbs are stiff and stilted. Tympany of the rumen sets
in early with oppressed breathing and arrest of defecation and
urination, which had been already difficult. The reflex excitability
to noises, or other causes of disturbance is often less than
in the horse. In cases following metritis, this may be due in
part to the depressing poisons absorbed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span><i>Sheep and Goat.</i> Show the same general rigidity of trunk and
limbs, the drawing of the head and neck upward and backward,
the elevation of nose and tail and the firm closure of the jaws.
As the disease advances they may lie on the side with legs straitened
and rigid and head and tail raised toward the back. The
occlusion of the eye by the haw is the same as in the horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>swine</i> the spasms begin with the jaws and face, and extend
to the neck, back and limbs with the same general symptoms as
in other animals. Champing of the jaws and profuse frothing at
the mouth have been noted and the protrusion of the haw is
characteristic. As in sheep, the animal may lie on its side with
head and limbs rigid and an early death may be looked for.
Convulsions are easily distinguished by their transient character.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>In dogs</i> tetanus is rare. Möller had two cases in 50,000 sick
dogs, Friedberger and Fröhner but one out of 70,000. Cadiot
saw two cases in ten years of the Alfort clinic. Labat had several
cases in sheep dogs. A slight transient trismus has been noticed
as common in puppies. When generalized there is stiffness of
the trunk and limbs, abduction of the members. The spine may
be straight and rigid or drawn upward and backward, and the
loins depressed. The haw covers the eye more or less, the lips
are rigid, the jaws clenched, and the skin of the forehead
wrinkled. The ears are stiff and drawn toward each other, or
backward. The reflex excitability is as great as in the horse,
the slightest touch or sudden noise producing violent paroxysms.
Inability to bark is a marked feature. Temperature may be
normal or up to 107° F.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>In birds</i> it is very rare, in keeping with the insusceptibility to
strychnia, ergot and other tetanizing agents. Dreymann gives
one case in a <i>turkey</i>, and Babes’ experimental cases in pigeons and
chickens from a specially virulent bacillus obtained from the
horse. The pigeons suffered much more certainly and severely
than the chickens, in which there was a marked power of resistance.
Dreymann’s turkey moved with stiff limbs and body,
had the wings clinging firmly to the body, the head and neck
extended and the bill firmly closed. The haw protruded over the
eye, and there was hurried and oppressed breathing.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Course.</i> <i>Duration.</i> The course of tetanus varies with the
genus affected, with the individual susceptibility and above all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>with the length of the incubation, and severity of the attack.
Cases that set in with great violence after an incubation of two
or three days or less are likely to advance to an early death. An
early generalization of the spasms, with high temperature
(104° F), hurried breathing, congestion of the mucosæ and extreme
excitability may end fatally in twenty-four hours or within
a week.</p>

<p class='c008'>If on the other hand the incubation appears to have extended
over one, two or three weeks; if the disease is at first equivocal,
with some stiffness and firmness of the muscles, but with little or
no trismus; if the patient can open the jaws an inch or more and
masticate even slowly for a number of days after the onset of the
first symptoms; if the haw projects only slightly over the eyeball
and the excitability is not extreme the prospect for recovery
is much better. Such tardy cases may seem to stand still for a
week and then have a slight aggravation and this may be repeated,
or a slow improvement may set in and go on gradually to
complete convalescence. Improvement may be manifested by a
softer or more relaxed condition of the muscles, by a slightly
freer movement of the limbs and jaws, by a greater ease in
swallowing, by encreasing movements of the ears and eyes, by
the lessened projection of the haw, by the freer breathing and
circulation and by the permanent lowering of temperature to the
normal standard. Convalescence is always slow, but especially
slow in severe cases in which time must be allowed for repair not
only of the central nervous lesions but also of the ruptures and
trophic changes in the muscles.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>cattle</i> the disease is usually slow in its progress and improvement
may not set in till the close of the third week. In
sheep, goats and dogs on the other hand it is habitually acute,
and death may supervene from the third to the eighth day. In
the horse all forms are met with and the result will vary according
to the severity of the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality.</i> Friedberger and Fröhner sets the mortality in
sheep and pigs at nearly 100 per cent.: in horses at 75 to 85 per
cent.: and in cows at 70 to 80 per cent. In tetanus neonatorum
in lambs, the deaths reach about 100 per cent. In this case the
disease usually sets in within forty-eight hours after birth, and
with a very high temperature difficult deglutition becomes a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>marked feature, so that if the patient is not speedily killed by
dyspnœa, it soon perishes from starvation and exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>cause of death</i> is usually <i>asphyxia</i>, <i>hyperpyrexia</i>, or <i>exhaustion</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> There are no constant or pathognomonic structural
changes in tetanus. Those that are found are inconstant and as
a rule secondary. A wound (entrance channel) can usually be
made out, often in the region of the foot, or in connection with
castration. In the new born there is the unhealed navel, and in
parturient cows the catarrhal, septic or injured womb. In the
seat of such wound may be found the foreign body (nail, splinter,
etc.), and some pus or simple congestion or even necrosis. The
nerve trunks leading from such infected wound may be hyperæmic.
The presence of the bacillus in the wound may be determined
by microscopic examination or inoculation on a small
animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The changes in the nerve centres may be congestion of the
horns of gray matter, and there may be slight hæmorrhage,
exudation, especially shown in the encrease of the cerebro-spinal
fluid, softening, cell proliferation, and granular invasion of the
nervous tissue. In separate cases the myelon, the corpus striatum
and the cerebellum have shown lesions. The meninges are occasionally
hyperæmic. Spinal lesions have been noted especially
in the bulbo-cervical and lumbar regions. Exceptionally in the
horse there are blood extravasations from fractures or dislocations
of the vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c008'>In subjects dying of asphyxia the lungs and right heart are
congested, and the blood may be black, only loosely coagulable
and with free hæmoglobin. There is congestion of the intestinal
as of the respiratory mucosa, and also of the liver, spleen and
kidneys. The congested bladder usually contains urine contrary
to what is the case in rabies.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> From <i>strychnia poisoning</i> tetanus is distinguished
by the gradual and progressive approach of the spasms and by
the absence of the intervals of complete relaxation which separate
the rapidly recurring and violent spasms of strychnia. In tetanus
the spasms may be modified but never completely intermitted, and
more or less stiffness, trismus and protrusion of the haw constantly
persist. In strychnia too, the paroxysm is far more intense than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>in the early stages of tetanus. The spasms of strychnia are
general, while those of tetanus are often most intense in particular
groups of muscles often at first in the vicinity of the inoculation
wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>rabies</i>, tetanus is easily distinguished by the absence of
any history of a bite; by the persistence of the tonic spasms
especially of the masseters and abdominal muscles during the
intervals between the more violent paroxysms (in rabies there is
temporary complete relaxation); by the absence of clonic spasms
which alone occur in rabies; by the absence of the paralysis
which characterizes advanced rabies; by the mental clearness
and the absence of hallucinations or mischievous disposition which
are marked features of rabies; by the absence of the depraved
appetite of rabies; and by the fact that the brain does not contain
the infecting germ as is the case in rabies.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>rheumatism of the neck</i> (torticollis) tetanus is easily distinguished
by the permanent trismus which is not shown in rheumatism,
and by the fact that spasms are easily roused by any
artificial excitement, indicating an extraordinary hyperæsthesia
and excitability which are nearly absent in rheumatism. The
steady unmistakable progress of tetanus is in itself diagnostic.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>meningitis</i> tetanus is to be diagnosed by the presence of
trismus without impairment of the mental faculties or fever. In
meningitis the spasms are usually confined to particular groups of
muscles and do not become generalized under active excitement as
in tetanus. Even if the spasms of meningitis affect the jaws and
pharynx they are rarely paroxysmal or roused by excitement as
in tetanus. They may even be clonic.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tetany</i> is more commonly localized in particular groups of
muscles, and shows longer and more irregular intervals between
paroxysms than does tetanus. It is improved by thyroid extract,
and may be roused at will to contraction by pressing on the nerve
going to the affected muscles.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Laminitis</i> in its most violent form and early stages, may be
confounded at first glance with tetanus, but the high fever, the
standing on the heels, the advance of the hind legs under the
body, the great heat and tenderness of the feet, the impossibility
of standing on one fore foot when the other is lifted and the
strong pulsation of the digital arteries, are sufficiently distinctive.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span><i>Treatment.</i> For fully developed tetanus no known resort of
therapeutics can be relied on. In slight cases that have shown a
long incubation and a slow increase and extension of spasm and in
those having trismus only, a recovery may be expected. Treatment
has been conducted largely on theoretic lines and may be divided
into antispasmodic, eliminating and antidotal or antiseptic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rest, darkness and absolute quiet are the first and main considerations.
A dark stall, with no straw litter, the rustling of
which often excites the patient, but rather a little chaff, saw dust
or even earth to prevent noise from the feet, and the exclusion of
all visitors are essential. As a rule slings should be put under
the patient so that he cannot lie, nor drop down, and this becomes
more imperative as the disease advances. The aggravation of the
spasms when down, and the danger of their extension to the respiratory
muscles are far more to be dreaded than the temporary
excitement caused by the application of slings. Food should be
sloppy mashes, of bran, middlings, oat meal, linseed meal, gruels
or milk, or green food may be allowed in moderate amount if the
jaws are still movable. It must not be forgotten that digestion is
impaired and food that is indigestible, especially fermentescible,
or in excess, may arouse fatal colics and bloating, yet in a protracted
exhausting disease like tetanus, the strength must be sustained
by all means in our power. Pure water should always be
accessible. Food and water should be furnished in buckets at a
level which will not necessitate either raising or dropping the head
to get to them (about 4 feet). The food must be given often,
in small quantity to avoid fermentation and spoiling. If noise
cannot be wholly excluded it may be an advantage to put cotton
wool in the ears. I have seen a mare recover when completely
covered with cotton wool under blanket and hoods.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Local antiseptic treatment.</i> Theoretically this is of great value
since the microbe is confined to the inoculation wound and by the
time the first symptoms appear, the spores have developed into
bacilli and are in a condition to be easily destroyed by disinfectants.
We can, therefore, by caustics or active disinfectants destroy
the infecting microbian colony, and prevent the further
entrance of any toxins into the circulation and nerve centres.
The principle has been shown experimentally successful in cases
of inoculation in the tails of cats and Guinea pigs, and the amputation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>of these members as soon as tetanic symptoms appear (Kitasato,
Babes). Unfortunately in too many cases, when first seen,
too much of the marvelously potent toxin has already reached the
nerve centres, and these have already undergone such changes,
that the disease is likely to go on to a fatal issue in spite of the
cutting off of future supplies of toxin. Yet the principle is sound
and proves helpful in proportion as it is applied nearer to the time
of infection. The most thorough method is the amputation of
the infected member, if like the tail or ear it can be excised without
ruining the animal. In 1875, Barbillon had success in again
amputating the tail, in a case of tetanus after docking. Next to
this comes the excision of the wounded tissues, but this can too
seldom be effectually and certainly accomplished, and we must fall
back on caustics and antiseptics. The actual cautery if thoroughly
applied may be trusted to destroy the bacillus along with the
tissues, but most of the chemical escharotics unite with the albumen
to form an impermeable film, which protects the tissues in
the deeper part of the wound against the antiseptic action. Of
the different antiseptic applications <i>carbolic acid</i> should be especially
recommended as being not only antiseptic, but also an antidote
to the toxins as shown below. It has the further advantage
of acting as a local anæsthetic, and of not coagulating albumen.
Creosote, creolin, lysol or other antiseptic may be used instead
and should be applied thoroughly to all parts of the depth of the
wound on a pledget of surgeon’s cotton or through a tube. When
agents so little destructive are employed they may be continuously
applied to the sores for a length of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Recoveries have taken place after neurectomy, and after
stretching the nerve going to the wounded part, the theory being
to check the afferent (sensory) nervous current, and arrest the
reflex spasms. The new irritation, however, caused by the surgical
wound is to be dealt with, and may itself turn the balance
against recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nervous derivation appears to have been beneficial in some advanced,
or partially convalescent cases. One horse after 14 days
illness (Taffanel) and another after 21 days (Prud’homme), were
castrated, bled freely and slowly recovered. Tisserand gives
another case without mentioning the stage of the disease. A
horse with advanced tetanus was taken to the seashore and shot.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>He fell into deep water, swam ashore and made a recovery. But
whatever virtue may be in elimination of the toxins by bleeding,
in nervous derivation or in the shocking of an unbalanced nervous
system, these can hardly be recommended as regular
methods of treatment. Yet the older veterinary records contain
many instances of alleged benefit from bleeding.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Internal treatment.</i> The whole list of antispasmodics have
been tried, with no very satisfactory result. Opium has been
extensively employed in spite of its tendency to encrease constipation,
and morphia given hypodermically has checked spasm
and induced sleep. Hydrocyanic acid and potassium cyanide
have shown a decided reducing action on the spasms with the
same drawback of favoring constipation. Potassium and other
bromides are useful in mild and chronic cases, and may be given
in full doses in combination with chloral hydrate. Calabar bean
and eserine have been given for their physiological action on the
nerve centres, and recoveries have followed their use, but they have
little effect on the spasms until the system has been saturated to
the point of threatening collapse. Chloroform has the advantage
that it can be easily given by inhalation, but while it may
be pushed to the extent of temporarily checking the spasms, yet
these return at once when the action of the drug is exhausted.
Chloroform is always dangerous to a weak or exhausted heart
and cannot be given for any great length of time continuously.
It is, therefore, very unsatisfactory. Sulphonal and trional have
similarly checked the spasms. Gelsemium has given good results
in certain mild cases, but it must be pushed to the extent of
coming just short of poisonous doses, and the fear of an overdose,
together with its failure in severe cases, have prevented its general
acceptance. The same end has been sought by the use of
nauseating antispasmodic agents, as tartar emetic, tobacco, apomorphia,
and lobelia, but though useful in individual cases,
these are on the whole no more successful than other agents.
Phenacetin, antipyrin, acetanilid and cocaine have respectively
received credit for some recoveries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chloral hydrate commends itself as being at once a most potent
antispasmodic and hypnotic, and an antiseptic. It can, moreover,
be conveniently given as a rectal injection, thus avoiding the irritation
and excitement of administration by the mouth. Given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>in this way too, it tends to relaxation of the bowels, instead of
constipation. Carbolic acid which can be conveniently given by
enemata has an anæsthetic action.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Antiseptic and Antidotal</i> or <i>Antitoxin treatment</i> is more promising,
yet it has failed to come up to the full measure of expectation,
mainly because the nervous changes have already
reached a stage which cannot be undone speedily or at all.
Under this heading would come phenic acid (½ oz.) and probably
chloral hydrate (1 oz.), already referred to, and the various
compounds of iodine which may be here noted.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Iodine Terchloride.</i> <i>Iodine.</i> Behring and Kitasato secured immunity
of two months duration, by injecting the animal with
a filtrate of a culture of tetanus bacillus, and then injecting at
the same point 3cc. daily, for five days, of a 1 per cent solution of
iodine terchloride. Roux and Chamberland had similar results by
using iodine instead of the iodine terchloride, and maintained the
full measure of immunity by repeating the inoculation every
fortnight. Here it is evident that the action of the iodine is directly
antitoxic or antidotal, when introduced along with the
toxins and before they can reach the nerve centres.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Iodide of Potassium.</i> In an experimental case of general tetanus
in the dog, Babes had a recovery in ten days, by injecting subcutem
5cc. of Lugol’s solution and thereafter for eight days 10
to 30cc. daily. This suggests the use of this agent along with
phenic acid, or as an alternate, in any case in which phenol appears
to be losing its effect by use. It may be used hypodermically,
or in the drinking water or by rectal injection. It has an
advantage over phenic acid in being actively diuretic and eliminating,
while phenic acid has the recommendation that it tends to
lower nervous excitability and moderate the reflex spasm.
Theoretically the combination of the two agents, which do not
mutually decompose each other, should give the best results.</p>

<p class='c008'>These experiments have been often repeated showing clearly
the antidotal action of the iodine compounds when mixed with
the virus before inoculation, or injected with the virus into the
seat of the wound. When employed later when the symptoms
have developed, everything depends on the changes already accomplished
in the nerve centres, and the severity and generalization
of the spasms.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span><i>Serum Antitoxin Orrotherapy.</i> Babes appears to have been
the first (1889) to use the serum of animals (rat) recovered from
tetanus in mitigating and curing tetanus in experimental cases.
An attempt on a well developed case in man failed. His method
of preparing the serum is as follows: A horse of 900 lbs. (461
kgm.), is inoculated with a mixture composed of 0.5cc. toxin
(of which 0.001 mgm. kills a mouse) and 0.5cc. iodo-potassium
iodide, and then at intervals of four or five days of 2.5cc., 4, 5
and 10cc. of the iodine mixture. Then stronger mixtures are
used: first 2 parts of toxin to 1 part of the iodine mixture; dose
10cc.; then 3:1 dose 10cc.; then 4:1 dose 5cc.; then 15:1 dose
10cc.; then 30:1 dose 25cc.; and finally virulent cultures in progressively
encreasing doses 10, 20, 30 and 50cc. One week after
the last injection 1cc. of the blood serum will antidote 50cc. of
toxin. Injection of toxin is however continued and the dose is
gradually raised to 200cc. Eight or fourteen days after the last
injection the blood serum may be taken for protective purposes.
He has prepared antitoxin from cows in the same way, and
Brieger and Ehrlich have prepared it from the goat. Chickens being
naturally refractory to tetanus toxin can bear large doses and
a potent antitoxin is more speedily secured from them. In the
case of the cow the milk is rich in antitoxin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other methods of preparing an animal for producing the antitoxin
have been resorted to as injecting it with a mixture of toxin
and antitoxin in increasing doses, or again injecting with a mixture
of toxin and thyroid extract in increasing doses. The extract
of the normal thyroid contains a natural antitoxin.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be fairly inferred that the antitoxin is not formed in the
nerve cells alone in their resistance to the toxin, but also in the
thyroid, the liver (bile having an antitoxic action), and perhaps
in other organs or liquids.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blood of the immunized animal drawn through the sterilized
cannula and aspirating syringe is coagulated in vessels set
on ice, and the serum when separated is mixed with 0.5 per cent.
carbolic acid and 1 per cent. chloroform, and kept in the dark in
well closed bottles. It will usually keep for years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early experiments with antitoxins showed that when mixed
with the toxin before injection it could be trusted to neutralize
it. Ehrlich, Tizzoni and Cattani even claimed success in all experimental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>subjects if employed as soon as the slightest symptoms
of tetanus were shown. They found, however, that it required
1000 to 2000 times the amount of antitoxin in such cases than was
required when it was mixed with the toxin prior to injection.
They found, moreover, that when the disease is fully developed
the dose must be 150 times more than is required when the first
symptoms are shown. It should be added that when the disease
has developed rapidly, after a short incubation, and is well advanced
the antitoxin treatment is usually of little avail. The
changes in the nerve centres are already too great to allow hope
of recovery. In man the ratio of recoveries are about as follows:
After incubation of 10 days or under, 3 to 4.5 per cent. recover.
After an incubation of 11 to 15 days 50 per cent. recover (Woodhead).
Lambert claims 46 per cent. recoveries in 114 cases,
and 38.71 per cent. recoveries in acute cases with an incubation
of 8 days and under.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the whole the ratio of recoveries is greater under the antitoxin
treatment than before, though far from sustaining the optimistic
views of Behring and other early experimenters. Babes
draws attention to the fact that spore laden splinters of wood, in
the wound render the antitoxin useless as a continuous succession
of fresh spores, bacilli and toxins are thereby supplied. As this
is one of the most common forms of casual infection it interferes
seriously with the success of antitoxin treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roux and Borrel found that in animals, intracranial injection of
the antitoxin was the most effective method. Recovery also followed
its injection into the cerebrum of a tetanic boy. Babes had
recoveries in two cases out of three with cerebral or intracranial
injections. As the reflex spasms depend on the spinal centres
these would seem to be the ideal points of injection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Babes who has done a large amount of subcutaneous and intraperitoneal
injection of antitoxin, employed for man doses of 300
to 500cc., which would represent 8 to 10 ozs. as the dose for an
ordinary horse. As the antitoxin is rapidly eliminated from the
body, these should be repeated daily or every other day. Nor
should this supercede other curative measures. The leading
principles may be thus stated: 1st. Antitoxin should be used at
the earliest possible moment. 2nd. The infected wound area must
be thoroughly disinfected or destroyed by caustics, and that at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>once. 3rd. The antidotal treatment by phenol and iodine must
not be omitted. 4th. Palliative treatment by antispasmodics, narcotics
or soporifics must go hand in hand with antitoxic treatment.
5th. Measures should be taken to secure elimination of
the toxins present in the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment by brain emulsion.</i> Wassermann and Takaki (Berlin
Klin. Woch. Jan. 3d, 1898) have in a number of cases,
mixed 1cc. of brain substance of a warm-blooded animal with ten
times the lethal dose of tetanus toxin and injected without producing
any symptoms of tetanus. They obtained a similar immunity
by injecting the brain emulsion 24 hours after the injection
of three times, and in other cases of five times the lethal
dose of tetanus toxin. Control cases uniformly died of tetanus.
The brain matter was obtained from Guinea pigs, pigeons, rabbits,
horses, and men. They accordingly advanced the theory
that brain matter is a direct antidote to the tetanus toxin, uniting
with it chemically and rendering it innocuous. The liver, spleen,
kidney, bone marrow and blood serum gave no such protection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marie, in a series of experiments, injected the brain emulsion
and tetanus poison at different parts of the body of Guinea pigs
and found that fatal tetanus ensued. It would appear, therefore,
that the brain emulsion acts by direct contact, and that it is only
by its meeting and combining with the toxin before the latter
reaches the spinal cord that tetanus can be prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roux and Borrel (Ann. de l’Instit. Pasteur, 1898) demonstrated
this union between the poison and brain matter, by making
an emulsion of the two, and putting in a centrifuge, which
will separate the brain substance from the clear liquid. The
fluid obtained in this way was shown by injection on the living
animal to contain almost no toxin. Knorr and Blumenthal
reached the same conclusion as to a chemical union with the
brain matter which robbed the toxin of its toxicity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Knorr, and Tizzoni, and Cattani and Morax showed indeed,
that if the tetanus toxin is injected subdurally or into the surface
layers of the cerebrum, it produces not tetanus, but a characteristic
cerebral disease. A dose of ¹⁄₂₀th or ⅒th cc. of tetanus
toxin produces in the rabbit, in 10 to 12 hours, restlessness, constant
change of place, and signs of great fear like hiding the head,
turning rapidly round, attempting to escape, polyuria, grinding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the teeth, epileptoid convulsions. The toxin in this case had
manifestly united with the brain substance while the cord suffered
little.</p>

<p class='c008'>Metchnikoff (Ann. de l’Inst. Past., April, 1898) holds that
the brain matter is only valuable in holding the toxin until it can
be destroyed by the leucocytes. He showed that the injection
of the tetanus toxin in chickens or Guinea pigs greatly encreased
the production of leucocytes. He injected tetanus toxin into the
aqueous humor of the rabbit without producing much effect, but
when the same agent mixed with cerebral substance was injected,
the result was a great accumulation of leucocytes, and hypopion.
If the mixture of brain substance and tetanus toxins were injected
on the brain, little encrease of leucocytes occurred, but if
thrown into the peritoneum, a most remarkable leucocytosis took
place. In twenty minutes after the injection the fluid withdrawn
from the abdomen showed large numbers of leucocytes filled with
brain substance, but no free cerebral matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The present status of the treatment by brain substance is therefore
somewhat uncertain. The value of that agent in holding
the toxin is allowed, but like the antitoxin it must be employed
before the toxin has reached the nerve centres and united with
the living ganglion cells. Its use would be called for therefore
at the earliest possible moment and it should be continued so long
as there is reason to suspect the production of fresh toxin in the
wound. Its direct action on the toxin would suggest its injection
around an infected wound, or even as a dressing for the wound
in connection with antiseptics. When tetanus has already set in
it cannot be expected to undo the evil already accomplished by
the union of the toxin with the cells of the cord, though it might
in part arrest and hold new supplies of this poison coming from
the wound to the nerve centres.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> In a disease so deadly as tetanus and so refractory
to treatment even by antitoxin when it is once developed, prophylactic
measures are of the greatest importance. With the
extensive adoption of antiseptic surgery there has already been a
material diminution in the number of cases, yet a greater attention
is demanded to the prevention of casual cases which result
from ordinary wounds. Dirty, grimy wounds filled with the
dust of stable yard or garden soil, and such as contain splinters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>of wood, stones, thorns, straw and the like can only be considered
quite safe after thorough disinfection. It has been shown that
the toxin is easily neutralized at the time of infection, whereas,
after the disease is developed it will require 1,000 or 100,000
times as much antitoxin to produce the same effect. In the case
of soiled wounds, therefore, in a valuable animal, a harmless injection
of antitoxin or of phenic acid or iodine solution before the
development of tetanic symptoms is not an unwise precaution. A
succession of such injections might be given to ward off the
disease until after a lapse of time exceeding the short and dangerous
incubation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much more important is the disinfection of the wound itself.
All foreign bodies must be removed, but especially those that like
splinters of wood and straws are likely to harbor the spores of the
bacillus. Then the wound may be thoroughly cauterized thermically
or chemically, or it may be irrigated with a strong antiseptic
solution and then dressed with some agent that will prove
destructive to the spores, and antidotal to the toxin. Strong carbolic
acid may be applied to the whole raw surface including the
uttermost recesses of the wound, and after a few seconds or half
a minute this may be neutralized by filling the wound with dilute
acetic acid or alcohol, after which a dressing of Lugol’s solution
may be applied. Lambert advises a combination of hydrochloric
and carbolic acids.</p>

<p class='c008'>Weaker antiseptics, like a 5 per cent. solution of carbolic acid,
do more harm than good, as they destroy the pus and saprophytic
microbes and even the tetanus bacillus in the wound, without
affecting the tetanus spores, which finding no other microbes to
contest with them the possession of the field may find themselves
in a better position than before to develop into bacilli and cause
tetanus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tetanus neonatorum may be certainly prevented by the application
of a disinfectant plaster on the navel at birth. Over 50
years ago in Scotland this desideratum was met by applying on
the navel of the new-born child a soft and immaculately clean
piece of cotton cloth which had just been flamed over a light.
On the island of St. Kilda the former mortality of 67.2 per cent.
of new-born infants, was promptly abolished by dressing the
navel daily with iodoform. For new-born animals a cheap and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>convenient application may be made by incorporating 1 oz.
powdered iodine and 2 lbs. wood tar, and smearing this on the
navel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much may be done by disinfection of stables and yards where
the victims of tetanus have been. The anærobic germ soon loses
its virulence in free air and sunshine, and one has to dread
especially, filthy stables, collections of manure, contaminated
litter, wood, combs, brushes and buckets. In unpaved yards remove
the infected surface soil and replace by fresh disinfected
earth, or still better, well burned brick.</p>

<p class='c008'>For horses which are necessarily exposed to manure or contaminated
soil, it is commendable to wash the hoofs and pasterns
on returning from work and then sponge with a weak solution
(5 per cent.) of phenic acid. Another resort is to smear the
hoofs daily with an ointment of tar and lard, equal parts. This
cannot protect from infection by splinters of wood containing the
spores, but is to a large extent preventive in the case of bacilli
that might have been otherwise lodged on the surface and which
could have been carried into the wounds inflicted by nails and other
noninfected bodies. Careful shoeing is all important, to avoid
the bruises, suppurating corns and <i>gravelling</i> which make
openings for the ready entrance of the spore.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roux and Nocard recommend immunization by protective inoculation.
This is not only possible, but would be justified
economically in the case of valuable animals, or in all animals in
a district where the bacillus tetani is universally spread. The
method is the same as advised above for the immunization of
animals, for the production of antitoxin.</p>

<p class='c008'>In districts where tetanus is rare, the cost of universal immunization
against the disease would very far exceed the losses
front casual cases. Under such conditions it would be an
economical blunder.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Aphthous fever: Aphtha Epizoötica, Eczema
Epizoötica.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An acute infectious disease of the lower animals
but especially of ruminants, characterized by a slight
fever and the eruption of vesicles, or ballæ on the skin and mucosæ,
and usually those of the mouth, feet and teats.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Susceptible Animals.</i> The animals that prove the most obnoxious
to the disease are the bisulcates—large and small ruminants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>and swine. Man however is susceptible as are also horses, dogs,
cats and fowls, when they are inoculated or fed upon the infected
milk or other products. It is doubtful if any warm-blooded
animal enjoys an immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History, Geographical Distribution.</i> Toward the middle of the
eighteenth century this disease prevailed in Central Europe and
England. The latter country stamped out both this and the
Rinderpest, but it continued to prevail on the Continent and was
re-imported into England in 1839. It reached America through
an importation from England to Montreal in 1870, but owing to
more or less effective quarantine, to the absence of cattle traffic
from east to west, and above all to the prolonged confinement in
yards and stables during our northern winter, it burnt itself out
in the course of the year. In Asia it has prevailed from time
immemorial, and it was imported into South America in 1870.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Etiology.</i> This disease has long been known as caused by
infection alone. Excluded from England in the middle of the
eighteenth century it did not appear again until re-imported in
the middle of the nineteenth, and then speedily overran the
whole island except the breeding districts into which strange
stock were never taken. In South America it was unknown
until imported from the Old World into the Argentine Republic
and then it made a wide extension and maintained itself where
the stock was kept on unfenced ranches. In our fenced Northeastern
states it died out and has not reappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>The infection is especially resident in the vesicles or aphthæ.
From the mouth this is distributed, with the abundant drivelling
saliva, on pastures, roads, feeding and drinking troughs, ponds,
streams and halters, and readily communicates the disease to
healthy stock following in the same places. From the feet and
especially the interdigital space, it is left on the vegetation, buildings,
yards, cars, boats and all other possible media to infect
other stock in turn. From the teats it mingles with the milk so
as to infect the young suckling and all animals and men to whom
the milk may be given. It may become dried on litter and other
light objects and carried by the winds, or it may be carried on
the feet of men or animals including birds, but apart from this it
is not readily diffused and oftentimes a broad highway may set a
limit to its propagation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>The infecting microbe is not definitely known. Nosotti found
a micrococcus in the lymph of the vesicle, which stained readily
in aniline colors, was easily cultivated and pathogenic. Klein
found a streptococcus which, similarly tested, presented an equal
claim to be the causative factor. Bassianus and Siegel found in
the blood and tissues of a person who died of foot and mouth
disease a small oval bacillus, which they later obtained from the
vesicles of three children who were suffering from the disease,
and from animals attacked in two successive epizoötics. With
this they first successfully inoculated a calf and from the pure
cultures obtained from its blood, inoculated three calves and a
young pig.</p>

<p class='c008'>Löffler and Frosch, the recent commission on foot and mouth
disease in Germany, report that no organisms could be seen nor
cultivated from the lymph found in recent bullæ of the buccal
mucosa, though this lymph proved virulent when inoculated on
calves.</p>

<p class='c008'>They found that the lymph became inert when dried for 24
hours at 31° C. (88° F.), while it retained its vitality and virulence
after exposure for 9 months to a temperature of 0° C. They
concluded that it could not penetrate through the unbroken skin
nor mucosa, and that it was most effective when injected into the
blood or peritoneal cavity. One attack conferred immunity for 5
months. Blood from immune animals, injected into susceptible
ones, does not confer immunity, but 75 per cent. could be rendered
immune if injected with a mixture of the lymph from the
vesicle and double the same amount of the blood from the immune
animal. Animals so treated become immune to 100 times the
infecting dose. Filtered lymph was still virulent and the commission
suggests that the microbe may be so small as to pass
through the filter, and escape discovery by the most powerful
lenses. An object one fifth the size of the smallest known bacillus—that
of influenza—would be invisible under our best microscope.</p>

<p class='c008'>By actual experiment the virus has been found in the nose,
larynx, bronchia, stomach and intestines, but into all these the
virulent lymph of the bullæ can find its way. In the intestines,
indeed, in cases caused by feeding, bullæ have been found on the
mucosa.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>A most important question would be that of the virulence of the
milk, but inasmuch as the vesicles appear on the teats and even
on the openings of the milk ducts, and in bursting discharge their
contents with the milk into the pail, the milk becomes per force
infecting. The experiment of Hertwig and his students who
infected themselves by drinking the warm milk by way of experiment,
has been often repeated unwittingly by unwilling victims,
and the many cases of calves, pigs and chickens contracting the
disease by consuming the otherwise discarded milk leaves no room
for doubt that this product is often infecting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among conditions contributing to a spread of infection, nothing
is more potent than a free movement of ruminants, and swine
whether determined by war, trade, or the intermingling of
different herds on commons or unfenced ranges. In infected
countries, in which cattle are distributed through large central
markets there is always a wide extension after one of these fairs,
the infection being narrowly circumscribed to herds receiving
cattle from the fair, or those that have travelled on the same roads
or fields after the market cattle. It has repeatedly happened that
cattle shipped from the United States, where this disease has long
been unknown, have been found diseased on their arrival at a
British port, simply because they have been tied upon the passage
with halters formerly used on infected Irish or Continental stock.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in animals.</i> There is first a period of incubation
shorter in hot than in cold weather and varying from 36 hours to
6 days (exceptionally 15 days). It is altogether probable that
prolonged incubation is really delayed infection, the virus
having been attached to the feet for some time before it entered the
tissues. Cattle usually show the disease two days after exposure
in a public market, building or conveyance.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is first moderate hyperthermia (102° to 103° F.), indicated
by the clinical thermometer before there is any outward
sign of ill health. There may be erection of the hair, tremors or
distinct shivering, dryness and heat of the muzzle, redness and
even tenderness of the buccal mucosa and teats, saliva drivels
from the mouth or may show as a frothy mass at the commissures
or margins of the lips, and there may be grinding of the teeth
and a peculiar smacking of the tongue and hard palate which may
be heard at a considerable distance. There are greatly impaired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>appetite and rumination. Tenderness of the feet is shown by
halting or lameness and by the extension backward and shaking
of the hind feet in turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the appearance of the eruption, usually on the second
day of illness, the fever as a rule moderates, and on examination of
the mouth bullæ of ⅓d. to 1 inch in diameter may be found on the
inside of the lips, and cheeks, or on the palate and tongue, with,
in many cases, a congested areola, but showing no nodule as in
variola. These bullæ may extend to the muzzle, pituitary membrane
or pharynx. They burst very soon after their formation,
exposing a red base of inflamed corium, with a clearly rounded
margin, or, at first, with shreds of the torn epithelial covering.
The salivation now becomes more profuse, glairy and even
bloody, and there is more active movement of the tongue. When
the bullæ have been confluent there are formed extensive red
patches denuded of epithelium, and the suffering causes a complete
but temporary dysphagia. The renewal of the epithelium,
however, takes place promptly and may be well advanced in four
or five days. Upon the teats the bullæ appear at about the same
time but are usually smaller than the buccal, and do not show the
thickened base of cow pox. They burst in 36 to 48 hours unless
broken earlier by the hands of the milker, forming sores comparable
to those of the mouth, which are liable to be kept up by
the necessary manipulations in milking.</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon the feet the eruption shows especially in the interdigital
space, at first as vesicles smaller than those of the mouth and
teats, leaving erosions and ulcers which extend under the adjacent
horn, and upward on the front and back of the pastern. From
exposure to mud and filth these are liable to be kept up even
longer than those of the mouth and teats, and under neglect the
entire hoof is often shed. In sheep and swine the disease may be
localized almost exclusively in the feet. Sheep will even walk on
the knees.</p>

<p class='c008'>In young animals and those fed on the milk, the eruption may
take place on the intestinal mucosa with violent congestion, diarrhœa
and a fatal issue. Aggravated cases may show gangrenous
mammitis or abortions.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality and Prognosis.</i> While there are seasons of special
pathogenic severity, yet as a rule, the foot and mouth disease is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>a mild affection and unless neglected, the patients entirely recover
in about fifteen days. The pecuniary loss in dairy and
feeding cattle has been found to average in Great Britain about
$10 per head, and as few animals escape, the consequences are
usually very serious. In England the losses from this disease in
1883 reached $5,000,000, in France, those of 1871 were $7,500,000
and in Switzerland, $2,500,000. In Germany, over 7,000,000
animals suffered from 1889–94.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Differential Diagnosis.</i> While a mistake might be made in an
isolated case, such a thing should be absolutely impossible where
cattle and other animals are collected in herds. The rapid infection
of the whole herd, the implication of sheep and swine along
with the cattle, and the eruption of the characteristic bullæ on
the mouth, feet and udder or on two of these locations to the exclusion
of the rest of the body, is not likely to be counterfeited
by another disease. An outbreak of gangrenous ergotism in
Kansas, Missouri and Illinois in the spring of 1884, was pronounced
to be foot and mouth disease by a number of veterinarians,
including an expert sent by the Government of Canada.
On behalf of the U. S. Treasury I investigated the disease, which
caused in many cases sores on the mouths and feet, but it spared
all sheep and swine, could not be conveyed to them nor to new
born calves by inoculation, and in many cases it caused gangrene
of all the tissues, soft and hard, and separation of the limb at a
given point, often near the tarsus. The quarantines were raised,
the disease made no further extension, and the existing panic
subsided.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Infection of Man.</i> The first authentic record of this affection
in man we owe to Valentin, who records that during the outbreak
in Hesse in 1695 men suffered from inflammation of the gums,
tongue and mouth. Michel Sagar says, that in 1764 men who
drank the milk were affected with aphtha. In 1828 it was conveyed
from animals to men in Bohemia (Nadberny), in Styria
(Levitsky) and Wurtemberg (Kolb). In 1834, three veterinarians,
Hertwig, Mann and Villain, voluntarily drank a quart
each of the warm milk of a cow suffering from this affection.
On the second day Hertwig suffered from fever, headache and
itching of the hands and fingers. Five days later bullæ formed
on the hands and fingers, the tongue, cheeks and lips. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>two others the eruption was confined to the buccal mucosa.
Since that time records of the infection of human beings have
been very numerous. During the American epizoötic of 1870 I
met with the case of a farmer at South Dover, N. Y., who suffered
from sore mouth and blisters along the margin of the
tongue from drinking the milk. The danger is greatest in children
on an exclusive milk diet and who drink it warm. Kolb in
1828, noticed acid vomiting and diarrhœa in such subjects, Hübner
observed that beside the buccal eruption such children often
suffered from inflammation of the stomach and bowels and that
very young children fed on the milk of the diseased cows died.
Balfour, Watson and others have noticed similar results in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Allbutt saw the buccal eruption in three children in Yorkshire,
England, during the local prevalence of the English epizoötic in
1883, and secured information of a number of other cases in the
same district.</p>

<p class='c008'>A number of cases were recorded during 1893 in Germany. A
shepherd infected himself by holding in his mouth the knife with
which he had pared the diseased feet of sheep, and another workman
and a veterinarian had extensive eruptions on the hands after
dressing the affected feet. A number of milk-maids were infected
by milking, the eruption appearing on the hands, and in one case
on the breast. A child fed on the milk of diseased cows, had
chill and fever with gastric disturbance, and later an eruption of
vesicles on the lips and tongue and between the fingers and toes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, in 1895, during the prevalence of foot and mouth disease
in the southern part of Berlin, a considerable number of the
milk consumers suffered from fever with the eruption of bullæ on
the tongue and buccal mucosa generally, which on early bursting
left very painful ulcerations. The acute disease did not last more
than five days, but left a sense of great weakness for a time.
Virchow, who made an investigation, unhesitatingly pronounced
it to be foot and mouth disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cases of infection through butter made from infected milk are
on record. A Berlin veterinary student suffered from the buccal
eruption and erysipelatoid swelling of the ear, and a German clergyman
had in addition a period of chilliness, fever, diarrhœa and
pruritus. Similarly Schneider quotes cases determined by infected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>cheese, and Friedberger and Fröhner, cases caused by virulent
buttermilk.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i> In man there is observed the tendency to
localization on the same points as in animals. As the hands are
naturally exposed to infection by milking or treating the diseased
animals, they are especially obnoxious to the eruption, and the
same is true of the mouth when the infected milk or other dairy
products are consumed. The bullæ on the buccal mucosa are
generally confluent, and often extend to the fauces and pharynx,
rendering speech difficult and swallowing painful, and leaving extensive
and painful sores which, however, soon heal up. In
women the bullæ have been seen around the congested nipples,
and in exceptional cases they have been generally diffused over
the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>In cases due to drinking the milk, the early febrile symptoms
are liable to be accompanied or followed by nausea, anorexia, abdominal
pain and diarrhœa, and still later by the cutaneous and
buccal eruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duration of the disease is from 10 to 15 days and as a rule
no permanent scars are left on the skin or mucous membranes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>diagnosis</i> is assisted by the knowledge of the prevalence
of the disease in herds in the district, and that the patient has
handled the diseased animals, or drunk their milk, or eaten their
butter or cheese products. The predilection of the eruption for
the fingers, the roots of the nails and the mouth is very significant.
The disease follows an acute course and convalescence is complete
in ten or fifteen days, which serves to differentiate it from most
skin eruptions. From variola which pursues an equally rapid
course it is distinguished by the absence of the primary nodular
swelling, and of the septa or pillars that divide the mature pock
into independent chambers.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prophylactics.</i> The best prevention for man is to exclude the
disease from the country and its herds as is now the case in the
United States. When the disease does exist in herds the attendants
should cauterize any sores on the hands, and wash the hands
with an antiseptic, such as a 10 per cent. carbolic acid solution,
after handling the diseased. The milk and its manufactured
products—butter and cheese—should be withheld from consumption
until after the herd has recovered. Infection can be obviated
by boiling the milk.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span><i>Treatment.</i> The disease follows a rapid course and is self-limiting,
and usually benign so that active treatment is not
urgently demanded. The local lesions are best met by non-poisonous
antiseptics, such as: borax in powder or strong solution;
boric acid (4:100); sodium hyposulphite (½ oz. 1 qt.);
chlorate of potash (½ oz. to 1 quart); salicylic acid (1:100); or
salicylate of soda. Pounded ice may be used as a soothing agent.
The cutaneous lesions may be wrapped in cloth wet with one or
other of the antiseptic lotions. Any disposition to ulcerate may
be met by the stick of silver nitrate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slightly laxative or diuretic agents may be employed for their
febrifuge and eliminating properties and the food should be light,
easily digestible and given cold.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention in Animals.</i> When the disease exists in a country
or district this includes all measures preventive of immediate or
mediate contagion. Arrest of all movement of cloven footed
animals in infected districts, disinfection of cars, boats and other
conveyances, of markets, yards, highways, seclusion of infected
herds and pastures, exclusion of visitors, disinfection of products,
certificates of soundness of origin, thorough disinfection after
recovery of the herd, such are the leading points to attend to.
Inspection or closure of fairs and markets is desirable and any
exposure of diseased or infected animals should be visited with
heavy penalty, in addition to the cost of detention and supervision.
For a noninfected country a certificate and guarantee of
non-exposure with each cloven-footed animal imported, and of
thorough disinfection of the cars, boats, halters or other objects
used upon them, and of the places, fodder and litter supplied,
together with a quarantine (1 week) and surface disinfection
should be required under penalty. Exclusion of fresh hides,
bones, guts, hair, bristles, wool, horn, as well as of fodder and
litter is essential. Cattle attendants, drivers and others whose
clothes are soiled with the products of the barn, should have the
same washed and disinfected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inoculation has been proposed, and even practiced to pass a
whole herd promptly through the malady, but as immunity lasts
but three months, and the attendant risks to other herds are
greatly encreased it is at once an economic blunder, and a great
injury to adjoining owners. Any resulting extension to other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>herds should be an occasion for a verdict for damages at common
law.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment in Animals.</i> Provision is first made against extension
of the infection. The floor should be kept clean, dry
and covered with sawdust, tan bark, gypsum or litter sprinkled
with these or with phenic acid. The herd should be divided into
two lots—the apparently sound, and unsound kept strictly apart
under separate attendants, above all separate milkers. As soon
as any symptoms are shown by an animal in the sound enclosure
it must be instantly transferred to the other and its stall disinfected.
Antiseptics such as gaseous iodine (two tablespoonful of
tincture of iodine, thrown into a quart of boiling water twice
daily), sulphurous acid, salicylic acid, creolin, lysol or other
ointment on the feet and teats, may also be used. In this way it
may be possible to save a number from an attack, yet most commonly
the exposure is common and universal and the malady develops
in all simultaneously. For those already attacked, gruels,
mashes, and cool pulped, finely sliced or boiled roots may be all that
is required, the disease runs its course and recovery ensues in 15
days. As local dressings the following may serve as examples:
for the mouth, borax, chlorate of potash, salicylate or sulphite of
soda 2 drs. to 1 quart water; phenic acid, creolin, or lysol, one or
two teaspoonfuls to a quart; for the foot, clean the interdigital space
and apply tar and carbolic acid with bandage, or use solutions of
creolin, lysol, pyoktanin or blue-stone; in aggravated cases strong
mineral acids with tar; for the teats, ointments of boric or
salicylic acid, creolin, lysol, naphthalin or napthol. Separation
of the hoof or mammitis will require treatment according to indications.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MILK SICKNESS. “THE TREMBLES.”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Geographical distribution: timbered lands in the United States; different
altitudes, and geological formations; on hills and wooded bottoms; known
to Indians and pioneers; now unknown where formerly prevailed. Contagion:
through milk; no specific microbe found in every case. Alleged
causes: rhus; nickel; spirillum; bacillus. Prevails in dry seasons; contracted
under night exposure; confined to given enclosures; to late summer
and autumn. Not conveyed by contagion, indefinitely, as are plagues. Men
show very varying susceptibility; young children may be relatively immune.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>Fatigue, debility, ill health, predispose. Exertion to fatigue rouses symptoms
in animal affected. Cow in full milk eliminates toxins and does not
show symptoms; the milk infects. Steers, bulls and heifers, show marked
symptoms. Calves suffer through milk; swine through veal; dogs through
pork; buzzard through dead dog. Incubation 8 to 12 days. Symptoms:
tardy, lazy gait, drooping, anorexia, ardent thirst, inactive bowels and kidneys,
milch cows when driven or excited, tremble and may suddenly die.
Muscular debility, constant decubitus, complete apathy, neither evades nor
resents injury. Bloodshot, fixed, glazed, unwinking eyes, pulse and breathing
slow, temperature low, hebetude, torpor, coma; death 8th to 10th day.
Sheep very prostrate. Calves tremble when sucking, vomit and perhaps die
suddenly. Pigs and dogs vomit, and show costiveness, remarkable debility
and weariness. Man is weary, languorous, weak, apathetic, loathes food, is
nauseated, retches. No fever; but ardent thirst, tremulous tongue, mawkish
breath, soft flabby belly, careless of own or family interests, forgetful
of decency. Nausea, vomiting of blueish liquid, hebetude, inactive bowels,
coma. Lesions: gastro-intestinal congestions; ingesta like hard balls of
sawdust. Treatment: charcoal, mild laxatives, elm bark, egg nog, potassium
permanganate. Prevention: clear timber land, let in sunshine, cultivate.
Insects. Sterilize the milk.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is an infectious disease which has been found enzoötic in
certain unimproved, timbered lands of North Carolina, Georgia,
Tennessee, Kentucky, W. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana
and Illinois. Beach says it has never been reported on any
of the Western prairies, at any point west of the Mississippi
River, in New England, in the Canadas, in any islands, or in
any part of the Old World. Altitude appears to have no effect
in its production, nor geological formation; it has been found in
the wooded mountains of the Blue Ridge of N. Carolina and
Georgia (Kerr, Salmon, Phillips); in the hills of Pennsylvania
and Kentucky; (Beach, Phillips); on timbered uplands
(Phillips); and on the wooded bottoms of the Scioto and Miami
in Ohio (Phillips, Schmidt); in the timbered bottom lands of the
Wabash and White Rivers in Indiana (Phillips); and in the
wooded bottoms (Beardsley), and Indian Grove in McLean, Co.,
Ill. (Beach). The constant conditions are the heavily timbered
and virgin condition of the soil.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was much more prevalent in the time of the early settlers,
than it is to-day, many infecting localities having become salubrious
in connection with the clearing away of the forests and
cultivation of the soil. The disease was well known to the Indians
and often proved disastrous to the pioneers, whole communities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>being swept off as recorded of Pigeon Creek, by Nicolay
and Hay in their History of Abraham Lincoln. According
to these writers it was “a malignant form of fever—attributed
variously to malaria, and to the eating of poisonous herbs by the
cattle—attacking cattle as well as human beings, attended with
violent retching and a burning sensation in the stomach, and
often terminating fatally on the third day.” Even in these early
days settlers were loathe to acknowledge the existence of the
infection on their lands, doubtless because it depreciated them,
and to-day with a better knowledge of the necessary precautionary
measures, it has literally disappeared in many places, so that
it is now difficult to find a case.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Contagion.</i> That the disease has been transmitted through the
milk from animals to man and other animals has been too painfully
evident from the first, but no specific microörganism has
been found to be constantly present, capable of pure culture in
artificial media and of causing the disease when transferred from
such media to a new victim. Naturally all sorts of theories have
been advanced, no one of which has been demonstrably proved.
It has been attributed to eating of poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron)
by the cattle, as this plant was usually found on the infecting
lands, but rhus is also common throughout New England
and the Eastern States where milk sickness is unknown. It has
been claimed that it was due to mineral agents, especially nickel,
in the water but the mineral salts in the water are not removed
by culture of the surface soil, which puts an end to milk sickness.
Phillips (1876) claimed to have found the cause in an actively
motile spirillum in the blood, but he had examined the blood of
but one patient, and it has not been found in other patients by
subsequent observers. Bitting found a bacillus but further research
has not determined its constancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beach furnishes a series of observations which should be useful
in seeking to estimate the value of any theory propounded. 1st.
Milk sickness is a disease of dry seasons. 2. In unusually dry
seasons it is dangerous to leave domestic animals out over night
in the localities where the disease is prevalent. 3d. It has never
been considered dangerous for animals to pasture on such lands
in the day time. 4th. Cattle in one field will habitually escape,
and in another with apparently exactly the same conditions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>the same flora they are attacked. 5th. The disease is unknown
on the open prairies of the Western States, where the domestic
animals are not allowed to remain over night in the timber belts.
6th. With occasional exceptions, it is a disease of late summer
and autumn. The dangerous lots can, as a rule, be safely depastured
in winter and spring. 7th. The pioneers found that
they could protect their stock by keeping them corralled on a
“tame” piece of land from before nightfall until the fogs and
dews became dissipated on the following morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the land to become “tame” it was only considered necessary
to cut off the timber and let the sunshine act freely on the
surface. Plowing and cultivation did not seem to be requisite in
all cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great drawback to research is the difficulty of securing cases
to study. Many lots, formerly dangerous, are no longer so, and
others still infecting are kept so secluded that casual cases
cannot be found, without much expense for experimental animals.
Again, owners do not care to depreciate their land by acknowledging
that it is infecting. The experiment stations
naturally enough look askance, on the proposal to institute expensive
experiments on a disease which dies out when the soil is
improved. Deadly as the disease is to the individual attacked
(man or beast), it is not propagated indefinitely from non-milking
subjects, by simple contact or proximity after the manner of
plagues. It usually comes to an end by the death or recovery of
the subject that has contracted it by consuming meat, milk, butter
or cheese, the product of an infected animal. The demand
for sanitary police measures is, therefore, less urgent. Different
observers claim that cases occur in the large cities, through the
consumption of meat, butter or cheese, sent from infected localities,
but that the city physician fails to make a correct diagnosis.
These must, however, be comparatively rare.</p>

<p class='c008'>In addition to ingestion as a cause, certain accessory causes
ought to be noted. Some men eat the infecting material with
impunity, while others succumb to the deadly disease. As the
observations have all been made in or near the infecting localities,
individuals may be immune through a previous attack and
recovery, or there may be a native immunity through unknown
conditions. Young children often suffer less than adults, possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>because of the greater activity of their emunctories and
consequent elimination of the toxic products and the comparative
absence of exhausting or depressing conditions. Their purely
animal food (milk) may exercise an influence, and this may assist
in explaining the fact that certain adults appear to be refractory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fatigue, debility and ill health are said to predispose the system.
Milk sickness attacks most violently those that have been
subjected to overwork or severe exertion of any kind, especially
in hot weather, those suffering from want of sleep (sitting up with
the sick), those having a special cause of mental depression, those
suffering from some illness—constipation, indigestion, malaria, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Milch cows are probably more open to the attacks of the germ
because their systems are reduced by simultaneous milking and
breeding through a number of years. Exertion or fatigue has a
potent influence in developing the symptoms, so that it is a
common practice in the vicinity of infected localities to subject
animals to a good run before purchasing. Paradoxically enough
the infected milch cow which is distributing the infecting element
freely in her dairy products usually shows, in herself, no distinct
symptoms of the disease. If she is dry or farrow she suffers like
any other animal, but if in full milk, the toxins, and even the
hypothetical microbe, seem to escape in that secretion, which
proves highly poisonous to other animals, while the cow retains
her spirits, vigor and outward appearance of health. Steers,
bulls and heifers, on the other hand, show violent symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Calves suffer so long as they suck the milk. The dead calf is
eaten by swine, which suffer in their turn, and the dog contracts
the disease by eating one of these animals, or by taking infected
milk or cheese. The buzzard eats the dead dog and dies as the
result.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation</i> is from 8 to 12 days, though it may be reduced to
two. (Beach.)</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> In the domestic animals the first indication of
illness is a lazy, tardy disposition, The subject stands apart
from the herd, with drooping head and ears, listless, indifferent
to all around him, and often without appetite; or, in cattle or
sheep, rumination. There is usually extreme thirst, but without
correspondingly free urination or defecation. Peristalsis is virtually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>abolished and nothing whatever passes from the bowels.
The patient is likely to be found lying down and it is difficult to
get him up, and when raised he moves stiffly and with reluctance.</p>

<p class='c008'>In milking cows there may be no symptoms until the animal is
excited or fatigued by violent or continued exercise, as a hard
run, or a drive of four or five miles. This developes the tremors
alike in milch cows and in the mild cases in dry cattle or sheep.
The subject stands still and trembles in a striking way, the action
resembling the muscular contractions seen after the removal of
the hide in an animal newly killed. The head and ears are
drooped, movements are uncertain and stiff, and the animal may
even drop dead on the spot.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the disease advances the muscular debility becomes so great
that the animal lies down if possible, and if once down he seldom
rises again. The decubitus is extended, the head being stretched
on the ground. There is a most complete apathy, the subject
showing no fear, no apprehension, no disposition to escape or
resent injury. The wildest or most timid steer can be freely
handled, and there is no disposition to flight or retaliation. The
eyes are bloodshot and become fixed and glazed, winking ceases,
the breathing is slow, pulse infrequent, and temperature often
subnormal. The extremities and surface of the body are cool,
the muzzle dry, the coat usually stares, the apathy merges into
a complete hebetude, torpor and coma, in which condition the
animal often dies on the eighth or tenth day. Violent exercise
precipitates the death at once. Recoveries are infrequent and
attended by no critical discharge from bowels or kidneys, only by
a slow, at first almost imperceptible, resumption of natural action.</p>

<p class='c008'>The milder cases, those that show no appreciable symptom
when at rest, are seized with trembling or rigor when made to
undergo the slightest exertion; they appear haggard, stupid and
spiritless, drag their limbs slowly and stiffly and quickly stop
from pure weariness and debility.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prostration is even more marked in <i>sheep</i>, which often
seem unable to rise, or lack the nervous energy to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Calves</i> tremble while sucking, and will sometimes leave the
teat, vomit the contents of the stomach, fall down and perish.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>Vomiting Animals</i> (<i>pig</i>, <i>dog</i>,) emesis usually occurs, and
torpor of the bowels or obstinate constipation is present. <i>Pigs</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>burrow under the litter and are driven out with difficulty, and
<i>dogs</i> when called on to follow, do so reluctantly, slowly and
stiffly and fail to keep pace with their master (“the Slows”).</p>

<p class='c008'>In all animals alike active or continued exertion rouses or intensifies
the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>man</i> there is at first extreme langour, weariness and weakness,
the patient cannot be troubled to move, he loses appetite,
loathes food, and soon has nausea and retching—often from the
first. There is no chill, rigor nor violent headache as in other
fevers; but insatiable thirst; large, flabby, tremulous, moist
tongue, coated a dirty white; cold nose, ears and general surface;
dry skin; sweet, mawkish or offensive breath; flat, flabby
empty belly; without peristalsis or defecation. Respiration becomes
very slow, pulse weak and compressible, heart action
tumultuous and labored, temperature often below normal, and
though sometimes 99° or 100° F., never higher. The patient
takes to bed in four or five days, or, after exertion or fatigue, in
a few hours becomes profoundly apathetic, expresses no concern
for his business, his own future or that of his family, is intolerant
of bed clothes or other covering and utterly oblivious of the demands
of decency. Nausea continues, but retching becomes
weaker, and comparatively ineffective, or brings up a little liquid
which has been compared to blueing water of the laundry. The
apathy merges into a state of hebetude and this into coma, with
fixed, glazed eyes, absence of all winking, and insensibility to
irritants and death takes place quietly without a moan or
struggle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Recovery is slow, and improvement for a time is almost imperceptible.
In some cases there remains a nervous atony, and in
man, a lack of mental and bodily vigor, and a disposition to relapse
under exposure to intense heat or fatigue has been noted,
but in many cases recovery is complete and permanent without
lasting weakness.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> Both in man and animals, congestions of the gastric
and intestinal mucosæ have been noted, usually with a dark firm
condition of the membrane, but in some cases with capillary
stasis, and sloughing. Beach never saw indication of tenderness
in the abdomen or elsewhere, nor did he ever find blood nor
stercoraceous matter in the vomited material. The contents of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>stomach (paunch in cattle) and bowels formed hard balls like
cemented sawdust, firmly adherent to the dry mucosa.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment and Prevention.</i> Treatment by the Indians consisted
in giving large doses of powdered charcoal suspended in
milk. The early physicians attempted to open the bowels by
calomel and jalap, olive oil, magnesia citrate, and even croton oil,
but the last generally with fatal results. Milder and hardly less
effective treatment consisted in large doses of elm bark. Beach
believed he got better results with quinine and egg nog. It
might be suggested to try such antiseptics as potassium permanganate,
peristaltic stimulants like eserine or pilocarpin, as an
eliminating agent pure water or weak diuretics, and nerve stimulants
nitroglycerine or ammoniacal preparations.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prophylaxis.</i> The time-honored resort of clearing the timber
and brush land so as to let the sun act freely on the soil, and the
putting in of cultivated crops, is proved reliable and permanent.
The other precautions in use are valuable in protecting the herd,
but lack the merit of thoroughness and permanence and thus fail
to strike at the root of the trouble. They are: 1st. the exclusion
of domestic animals from the infected woods in late summer
and autumn and in very dry seasons; and 2d. the exclusion of
stock from such pastures from before nightfall until after the dews
have evaporated on the following morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The danger which attends on passing the night in the forest,
strongly suggests the intervention for the transfer of the poison
of some nocturnal animal, perhaps a night-flying insect, like the
anopheles, which transmits the plasmodium of malaria. If the
germ and its intermediate bearer (if any) were demonstrated,
probably other and simpler means of prevention could be adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fact that the propagation of the disease is not constant and
wide spreading, like a genuine plague, lessens the urgency for
a rigid sanitary police, yet animals kept on such infected farms,
should be tested by long or vigorous driving before they are killed
for food, and all milk devoted to the production of butter and
cheese should be Pasteurized or sterilized before use. It might
well be questioned whether the clearing and exposure of infecting
places should not be undertaken by the state as a sanitary measure.</p>

<p class='c008'>In view of the fact that a milch cow may not show symptoms
of the disease, and yet yield deadly milk, and considering that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>the owner cannot always tell whether she has been in the infecting
woods, or having been in, whether she is infected, it becomes
an important public health question whether such a source of
deadly disease should be perpetuated, where human food is open
to contamination.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the generic name <i>Variola</i> is understood a febrile malady
attended by a characteristic eruption on the skin, at first papular,
then becoming vesicular and finally pustular. The structure of
the vesicle is so characteristic that it may be taken to indicate the
variolous eruption as found in man and a variety of the domestic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>animals. The first indication of the lesion is the appearance on
the skin of fine points of congestion like fleabites. This is followed
by active diapedesis and proliferation of cells in the papillary
layer and rete mucosum, constituting the nodule or pimple
stage. In smallpox this is so firm and definitely outlined that it
has been compared to the presence of a shot in the skin. As the
proliferation of cells increases these form in separate clusters or
groups, isolated from each other by septa or walls largely made
up of the epidermic cells. In the next stage, therefore, when
exudation takes place the lymph accumulates in the spaces occupied
by the clusters of growing cells, and is found in a series
of chambers more or less perfectly separated from each other, so
that to evacuate the whole vesicle, each minute sac must be punctured
independently. The vesicles thus differ from others caused
by ordinary irritants in that each is chambered, instead of forming
one common undivided sac, which may be emptied by a single
puncture. In the next stage, when suppuration ensues, the septa
usually undergo liquefaction, so that the liquid occupies one
individed cavity in each pustule. For this reason the central
depression seen in the larger vesicles (cowpox) in their early
stage tends to disappear in the pustule. It may reappear later in
the resulting scab. Desiccation, scabbing and desquamation complete
the course of the affection, a distinct <i>pit</i> being left as a
result of the destruction of the superficial layer of the dermis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Nomenclature.</i> The term <i>variola</i> is believed to come from the
Latin varius (variegated, spotted) and <i>pox</i> from the Saxon pock
(pouch). The specific names, drawn from these tongues sustain
this view: As, <i>variolæ vaccinæ</i>, <i>cowpox</i>, <i>kine-pox</i>; <i>variolæ
equinæ</i>, <i>horsepox</i>; <i>variolæ ovinæ</i>, <i>sheeppox</i>; <i>variolæ caprinæ</i>,
<i>goatpox</i>; <i>variolæ suillæ</i>, <i>swine pox</i>; <i>variolæ caninæ</i>, <i>dog pox</i>.
The term <i>smallpox</i>, (<i>petite verole</i>) is deduced from the small size
of the vesicle as compared with that of cowpox, just as the
same has originated the term <i>smallpox</i> in sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History.</i> Variola has undoubtedly existed from very ancient
times. Moore found it referred to in Chinese records of 1122
years before Christ, but it was only clearly described early in the
tenth century by Rhazes an Arabian physician. Gregory, however,
found the name <i>variola</i> in Latin manuscripts in the British
Museum of a much earlier date. The early epidemics of small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>pox have usually extended from the east, and the disposition has
been to refer its origin to the crowded communities of central
Asia, but nothing is certainly known as to such origin and the
lack of definite recognition and description cannot be taken as
implying that the disease did not exist. The extension of small
pox to America in 1520 was distinctly traced to a sick negro
slave landed in Mexico, and the way in which it swept the continent
killing the Indians by tens of thousands, speaks strongly
for its prior absence and the extraordinary susceptibility of the
hitherto unaffected Indian races.</p>

<p class='c008'>The variolæ of animals are not recorded until later, the mildness
of the forms attacking cattle and horses, and the lack of
close observation of the diseases of sheep furnishing a reasonable
explanation. We must pass over as uncertain the <i>lues ovium</i> of
Thomas Wallsingham, (Historia Anglicana), imported in a <i>rotten</i>
Spanish ewe in 1274, and which prevailed for 25 years destroying
nearly all the sheep of the kingdom, also the reference to the
“pockes” of sheep in Chaucer’s “Pardoners’ tale” as highly uncertain.
Laurent Joubert in his work on the “<i>peste</i>” mentions
<i>sheep pox</i> as prevailing in 1567, and Rabelais speaks of it as prevailing
in France in 1578. It prevailed in Padua in 1649, in
Venice in 1664, 1672, and 1674 (Bottani), in Italy in 1690
(Ramazini), in Germany in 1687–8 (Stegman), in England in
1711, in Hungary in 1712, in France, Italy, etc., in 1714 (Kanold),
in Venice and Bohemia in 1719 (Bottani), in Saxony in 1720,
in Venice and France in 1723–24 (Bottani, Astruc), in Thuringia
in 1725, in Siberia in 1771 (Pallas), and in Persia generally
at the beginning of the 19th century (Bruce). Great Britian,
long protected by her insular position, was infected by sheep
from Germany in 1847 and again in 1862. Under ovination the
first invasion prevailed for four years causing wide spread
destruction; under strict separation based on thermometry, the
second lasted but four months.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cowpox</i> has existed in England for centuries, but it has only
attracted general attention since the introduction of vaccination
by Jenner in 1796. <i>Horsepox</i> has existed concurrently with cowpox,
the infection being habitually transferred by the hands of
the milkers from horse to cow and vice versa. Jenner found it
so common in the Valley of Gloucester, that he considered it as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the habitual source of cowpox. Sacco recognized it at the beginning
of the 19th century, Hertwig in Berlin in 1830, Röll in
Vienna in 1855, and Bouley and others later in different parts of
Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals Susceptible.</i> Variola in some form affects man, sheep,
cattle, horses, goats, pigs, dogs, buffaloes, camels and monkeys.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology and Infection.</i> It has long been well established
that variola is due to contagion alone. The habitual dread of
contact with a smallpox patient, shows the general appreciation
of the danger of contagion, and the many epidemics, started
by the introduction of a smallpox patient and thereafter
spreading from that as a centre, together with the long continued
immunity of certain insular or trans-oceanic countries illustrate
this. One of the most striking examples is the immemorial immunity
of the New World until the landing of the variolous slave
in Mexico in 1520, and the immediate, rapid and destructive
spread of the disease among the native tribes. Sheeppox offers
a no less striking example. Prevailing for centuries in Asia and
Europe, its extension to a new district was always the manifest
result of the movement of infected sheep; England remained
immune until her first invasion in 1847, and the second in 1862,
in both cases the source was easily traced, and the disease completely
extinguished by the destruction of the infection in its
circumscribed area; the more distant sheep raising countries,
America, North and South, Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand,
South Africa, in the absence of importation of infected sheep remain
free to the present time. For horsepox and cowpox the
demonstration is more difficult as limited outbreaks, have occurred
at intervals in different localities, traceable more or less clearly to
infection from vaccinated persons, yet often mistakenly attributed
to spontaneous developments of the disease. Before the days of
Jenner however it prevailed habitually in certain dairying districts
(Gloucestershire), and I can point to localities in New
York, in which the infection is manifestly laid up in the stables,
and the disease develops yearly in the heifers coming into milk
for the first time and in newly purchased cows, that have not
been previously exposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The contagion varies greatly in force in the different forms of
variola, the milder horsepox or cowpox, requiring actual contact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>(inoculation) while in smallpox and sheeppox, infection may take
place at some distance from the patient (in sheep over 200 yards).</p>

<p class='c008'>A particulate infecting material was demonstrated by Chauveau,
who filtered the virus and inoculated the filtered liquid without
effect, while the solids retained on the filter invariably produced
the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The identity of the microbe of variola has been much discussed.
Guttmann and Grigorjew found in the lymph a coccus
(Staphylococcus albus variolæ), Ruete a very motile diplococcus,
and others streptococcus, but in cutaneous lesions it is very difficult
to exclude such elements. Pfeiffer, Guarnieri, Van der Loeff,
Wasielewski and others have drawn attention to small protoplasmic
bodies (manifestly protozoa) found in the vaccine lymph,
and which appear to be the infecting agents. Wasielewski cultivated
these on a rabbit’s cornea to the 48th generation, and from
the last successfully inoculated a calf and several children.</p>

<p class='c008'>Funck finds this <i>sporidium vaccinale</i> constantly in the vaccine
lymph and surrounding tissue, as a refractile, amœboid, spherical
organism (spore) 1 to 3μ in diameter, and, less abundantly,
a round or ovoid spore cyst 25μ. These cysts are either smooth
or uneven like a raspberry, and have a single or double contoured
membrane. They are easily stained with Sudan III. Examined
in hanging drops they are seen just under the cover glass, not on
the surface of the drops. Larger flattened bodies found in the
lymph, with many included spores are manifestly epithelial cells.
Copiman cultivated the organism in glycerinated collodion capsules
in the peritoneal cavity of rabbits and dogs, producing zoöglœea
masses staining peripherically with methylene blue, and
which caused typical vaccinia in calves. He found the same elements
in variola of man.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HORSE POX. VARIOLA EQUINÆ.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This was recognized toward the end of the 18th century, in the
valley of the Severn, England, by Jenner, who believed it to be
the origin of cowpox, but failed apparently to distinguish it from
ordinary “<i>grease</i>”. To-day, when we must trace each case to a
preëxistent one in some animal, and ignore the question of primary
origin, we must still recognize that it passes readily from
horse to cow, and from cow to horse, through the hands of milkers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>and stable-men, but that it also has the source of vaccinated
persons in the families of those handling the horses. Whether it
was also often derived from the very prevalent small pox in past
times is doubtful, yet it appears to have been much more common
about the year 1800 than it is to-day. When once started in a
stable it passes readily from horse to horse, through the hands of
shoeing-smiths and grooms, including of course their aprons,
brushes, sponges and rubbers, and also through blankets, bandages,
litter and other things on which the virus has been received.
The susceptibility of the skin in the hollow of the pastern depends
mainly on the frequency of chaps and abrasions, and to a certain
extent on contact with the road-mud infected by other passing
animals. At times the suffering animal licks the affected part,
and determines the eruption on the mouth, lips and nose (see contagious
pustular stomatitis). Megnin saw cases affecting the
external generative organs and transmitted between the sexes by
coition. (See vesicular eruption on the genitals). All such cases
should be identified by inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hertwig, as early as 1830 recorded the existence of horsepox
in Berlin, where it has been seen frequently since, and noted its
transmission to man. Bouley gave evidence of its special prevalence
at Paris, and of the production of typical vaccine vesicles
in man by its inoculation. More recently it has been frequently
observed and studied by inoculation and otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> These, whether seen in horse, cow or man, do not
differ from those of cow pox, with which it may be held to be
identical. The observations of Chauveau, Warlomont, and
Pfeiffer that experimental infection, intravenous, subcutaneous, intratracheal
(inhalation), or by feeding almost always failed to give
the general eruption which characterizes small pox and sheep pox.
It remains strictly local except when inoculated on other parts of
the skin or mucosa. It must be added, however, that small pox
or sheep pox, when inoculated successfully on the horse, as a
rule remains confined to the seat of inoculation. The constitution
of the horse, like that of the cow, tends to resist its virulence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The affected horse may show preliminary febrile symptoms,
but these are usually too slight to be noticed. They are followed
by heat, tenderness and swelling of some part of the skin, usually
in the hollow of the pastern and perhaps the back part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>metatarsal region, with more or less (sometimes extreme) lameness.
On the swollen skin may be detected nodules, which may
pass early into vesicles and pustules. The eruption varies, however,
as developed on the comparatively hairless lips or nose, or
on the densely pilous pastern.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the lips, or other part lightly covered with hair, one can
easily follow the successive formation of the round nodule, the
distinct (sometimes umbilicated) vesicle, with its clear translucent
straw-colored contents, and the pustule, which bursts, forming a
sore, or dries up forming a dense scab, like that of cowpox.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the heels, or on any part thickly covered with hair, the
vesicle or pustule is rarely recognized, the exudate on the contrary
takes place mainly on the surface, which becomes encrusted
with an abundant yellowish concretion, matting the hairs together,
and sometimes literally covering them. This may be very misleading
to the practitioner who expects to see the succession of
fully developed vesicle and pustule, and overlooking the true
nature of the malady he may allow it to spread widely in a stable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Describing his inoculation cases, Chauveau gives the following
successive phenomena:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“From the fifth to the eighth day the points of inoculation become
distinctly papular. As far as about the tenth day, the
papules encrease, and become more prominent, taking the form
of an extremely wide cone, with a base of ⅓ to ½ inch. During
this period these large conical papules are resistant and painful
on pressure, but show no elevation nor change in the epidermis,
save a slightly reddish reflection in animals with white skins.
Afterward supervenes a new stage which may be called the
<i>period of secretion</i>. This commences from the ninth to the twelfth
day. The epidermis, slightly raised upon all the papule, sweats
out numerous drops of a limpid, very slightly yellow serosity.
These drops soon concrete into yellowish, transparent crusts
covering the whole surface of the pustule:—a species of characteristic
crystallization, very different from the crusts that succeed
the vaccine pustules in mare and cow. The secretion, which
continues several days, is terminated from the thirteenth to the
seventeenth day after inoculation. If then the crust is raised
there is exposed a humid, pink, granular surface not projecting
beyond the surrounding skin. This surface is hollowed out by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>very deep central cavity, a sort of umbilicus, in which is inserted,
like a nail, a projection from the deep surface of the crust.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I would add that after recovery the hair in the seats of the
nodules has a lighter color and, on the shanks and higher, remains
dappled for the season.</p>

<p class='c008'>No <i>treatment</i> is demanded. The application of a solution of
sodium bisulphite once or twice a day, or continuously on a
bandage, will greatly modify the intensity of the inflammation,
and ward off complex infections. If the skin is left tender or
with a disposition to crack, treat it as advised under chapped heels.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>COWPOX. VARIOLA VACCINÆ.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is manifestly the same disease, and due to the same microbe
as horse pox. The disease of the one genus is easily transmitted
to the other and the lesions and symptoms are the same,
as if the virus were derived from an animal of the same species.
Differences in the local manifestations appear to be due rather
to the varying conditions of the skin and hair follicles, than to
any material distinction in the virus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> Aside from the germ (Sporidium vaccinale) the conditions
which favor infection are: the milking of susceptible cows
with imperfectly washed hands, after dressing legs, the seat of
horse pox eruption; the milking of healthy cows after those affected
with cowpox; and the milking with hands contaminated
with the exudate in cases of vaccination of man. That susceptible
cows may also be inoculated successfully from smallpox
patients, under given conditions appears to be true, but in Western
Europe and America this is very uncommon, and would be
much more so if vaccination were universally carried out. Among
those who claim the identity of small pox and cow pox may be
named Ceely, Reiter, Babcock, Thiele, Voigt and Klein.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ceely alleges the infection of five cows and one heifer, in 1839,
in England, from chewing the flock of a bed on which a small
pox patient had died. In 12 or 14 days they had tender congested
udders, with hard pimples imbedded in the skin, followed
by blisters, and brownish scabs. The milk diminished, saliva
drivelled from the mouth, the cheeks were inflated and retracted,
the coat stared, their feet were drawn together, and the back was
arched. The disease was communicated to the owner. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>clearly an outbreak of aphthous fever, which invaded England in
that year, and was still an unknown disease to medical men. The
implication of the heifer which would not have been inoculated
with variola through the hands of the milker, and the salivation
which is unknown in cow pox, but points directly to the buccal
vesicles of foot and mouth disease, are conclusive on this point.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ceely later, after many fruitless attempts to convey smallpox
to the cow, at last met with results which indicated cowpox, and
which he thereafter passed from cow to cow with the characteristic
cowpox eruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fletcher further reports the transmission of smallpox through
the horse to the cow, and thence to the child in the form of cowpox.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1836, Thiele, Kasan, S. Russia inoculated some cows on the
udder with smallpox lymph, and conveyed the lymph of the resulting
vesicles back to man, and from man to man for seventy-five
generations of the virus without finding any variation from
the type of the true vaccine disease. He repeated the experiment
with equal success in 1838.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such experiments, made before the days of careful antiseptic,
or aseptic, laboratory methods, by men who were daily engaged in
making vaccinations, cannot be very implicitly relied on, yet the
success of Thiele in Central Asia, the early home of variola, may
indicate the possibility of a transition, under given eastern conditions,
which, to say the least, is exceedingly rare in Western
Europe or America.</p>

<p class='c008'>The experiments of Klein, conducted under modern methods,
are more conclusive, and seem to imply the possibility of smallpox
passing into cowpox, in the bovine system, under some not
yet clearly defined conditions. Until such conditions are sufficiently
well known, so that they can be controlled at will, no one
can be justified in attempting to produce lymph for vaccination
by simply passing smallpox virus through the system of the cow.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems important to note one or two instances of the evident
transmission of smallpox from man to man through the bovine
system.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1860, Martin inoculated variolous matter, from a man who
had just died of smallpox, on a cow’s udder, and subsequently
inoculated about fifty persons from the eruption caused in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>cow. Most of those so inoculated had unmistakable smallpox
and three died.</p>

<p class='c008'>Reiter had a very similar experience.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chauveau (French Commission) inoculated twelve susceptible
cattle with smallpox virus and produced, in all but one, small
conical (smallpox) papules and vesicles, and in ten of these, on
subsequent inoculation with cowpox, six proved immune, three
had rudimentary pustules, and one had a distinct cowpox eruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>A milch cow and two heifers were inoculated with smallpox
and cowpox on two sides of the vulva, with the result that each
disease appeared in the seat of its inoculation, with its characteristic
vesicles, and the two developed side by side. The smallpox
vesicles were by inoculation conveyed from ox to ox with steadily
decreasing activity. Inoculated from the cow on a child, it caused
great hyperthermia, vomiting, one large vesicle like vaccinia and
a general eruption like varioloid. Inoculation from this child
upon another produced a mixed eruption of cowpox and varioloid.
Inoculation from the second child on a bull and heifer produced
papular eruption only.</p>

<p class='c008'>Smallpox virus, inoculated on a horse produced a papular eruption,
but failed to affect another horse that had been previously
vaccinated. Cowpox virus inoculated on the first horse which
had had the papular eruption, caused a second papular eruption
(not cowpox). The virus from a vesicle in the first horse caused
a similar eruption in another horse, on which it was inoculated.
The lymph from the papular eruption led to a similar eruption in
cattle, on which it was inoculated, but did not protect against
cowpox, subsequently inoculated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lymph from the papular eruption in the horse, inoculated
on two children, produced fever, vomiting, a general papular
(smallpox) eruption, in which a few of the pustules only showed
a tendency to umbilication. A child and its mother in the same
ward contracted varioloid. A child inoculated from one of the
first named children, had six large umbilicated vesicles like cowpox
and a general papular (smallpox) eruption. Another child inoculated
from the last had six large umbilicated vesicles, and a general
papular (smallpox) eruption. From the papular eruption of
one of these children a horse and seven cattle were inoculated and
in all a varioloid eruption resulted.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>The rational conclusion is, that while there is every indication
of a primal identity of the two diseases, and indeed of all forms
of variola, as shown by a disposition of the virus from one genus,
when inoculated upon a totally different genus, to show some indication
of the characteristic eruption of the latter, yet the
generic type, which comes from the long continued growth in the
one class of animal, becomes so fixed, that it cannot be overcome
at once, and sometimes apparently not at all, by transferring it to
an animal of another class.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the unfortunate results obtained by Martin, Reiter, and
Chauveau, are insufficient to deter from the use of smallpox
lymph which has been passed through the cow, the long experience
with humanized vaccine, which in its inoculation from man
to man for a century has shown no tendency to revert to smallpox
virus should be a sufficient warning against such dangerous
optimism.</p>

<p class='c008'>No deduction can be safely drawn from the comparative mildness
of most of the cases caused by reinoculation from cow or
horse to man, inasmuch as that all forms of variola can be
rendered less severe by resorting to inoculation, which was extensively
practised to limit the ravages of smallpox before the
days of vaccination, and is still largely resorted to in the case of
sheeppox in Europe. In each of these diseases the mortality
can easily be reduced to 2 per cent. instead of the 20 to 50 per
cent. which are lost when the disease is contracted casually.</p>

<p class='c008'>As occurring casually, cowpox like horsepox is rare. Yet in
Denmark, a dairying country, 1,037 cases were reported in
1877–8, and 878 cases in 1888–9. I have found some outbreaks
explainable, through the existence of vaccinations in the families
of the milkers, and Bollinger says that in Germany, most outbreaks
take place in spring, the time when children are vaccinated.
He should have added that this is the usual time of parturition
in the cow, the time when primipara are first subjected to the
danger from the hands of the milker, and when the cow from the
noninfected district is brought into an infected stable for the
season’s milking. In a dairying district in Tompkins Co., N.Y.,
the affection appeared every spring, in the same barns, in heifers
with their first calf and in newly bought cows. All older cows,
bulls, steers and unimpregnated heifers escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span><i>Symptoms.</i> The period of incubation is two days, after inoculation,
and though it may appear to extend to a week when the
disease is contracted accidently, it is impossible in such cases to
state the exact date of infection. The preliminary fever is not
always present, or recognized, yet there may be slight encrease
of temperature, partial impairment of appetite and rumination,
extra firmness of the fæces, a higher color of the urine, and above
all a slight diminution of milk, which is a little more watery and
coagulates more readily, than the normal.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is followed by heat and tenderness of the udder and the
appearance on the teats of small, pale red nodules the size of a
pea or larger. In one or two days more the nodule, largely
encreased in size, presents in the centre a depressed or <i>umbilicated</i>
bluish white portion, with a firm yellowish, reddish or reddish
blue margin, and outside this a soft pink areola, shading off into
the white skin. The epidermis is raised at points by a viscid,
yellowish lymph, enclosed in a series of saccules (multilocular
vesicle). The vesicle encreases to 8 or 10 lines in diameter by
the eighth or tenth day, and exceptionally, the umbilication is
effaced by the excessive production of lymph. If left unbroken
a brownish shade appears in the centre and gradually extends
toward the periphery, the contents becoming purulent, and the
pustule gradually drying up to form a crust. The drying and
thickening of the crust goes on until the fourteenth day and the
crust is usually detached by the twentieth, leaving a pale rose
colored, smooth, shallow depression, which forms the permanent
pit left after the skin has healed. The primary scabs usually
show the central umbilication, and always the conical projection
in the center of the deep aspect, and corresponding to the pit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vesicles on the mammæ may pass through the above stages,
but those on the teats are usually ruptured by the hands of the
milker as soon as the liquid is thrown out, and this gives rise to
troublesome sores, with complex infections, at times implicating
the gland tissue so as to cause destructive mammitis with loss of
one or more quarters, and in any case abraded and irritated at
each milking, so that the animal resists handling, the milk is
drawn off imperfectly, and dries up or the cow becomes an inveterate
kicker. If the milker has not been vaccinated he is liable
to contract the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>A succession of vesicles often appear on the same animal, so
that they may be found in all different stages of vesicle, pustule
and crust on the same bag at one time. The later eruptions may
be the result of inoculation from the earlier ones, and tend to prolong
the attack materially.</p>

<p class='c008'>In inoculation of the bovine animal for the production of lymph
for vaccination, the skin of the abdomen from the symphysis
pubis to the umbilicus is shaved, or in other cases the skin between
the thighs, or in still others the skin on each side over the
loins, and the virus applied in 50 to 200 points, by preference
scraped until liquid oozes, but without any escape of blood. In
a warm room the eruption matures in four or five days, its form
taking on an appearance approximating that seen on the hairy
skin of the horse. The individual lesions are somewhat extended
corresponding in form and size to the abrasion on which the
lymph was applied, and usually present the appearance of a raised
patch, covered by a grayish film of epidermis, on the removal of
which there is seen a raw alveolated surface filled with the amber-colored
lymph.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Differential Diagnosis.</i> From <i>aphthous fever</i>, cowpox is clearly
distinguished by (a) the multilocular structure of the vesicle,
while that of aphthous fever is a single undivided cavity which
can be drained completely by a single needle prick; (b) by the
pitting or umbilication, the aphthous vesicle being uniformly
rounded and convex; (c) by the absence of vesicles or sores on
the mouth and feet, which are rarely wanting in the aphthous
eruption; (d) by the comparative absence of hyperthermia and
constitutional disturbance, which is better marked though still
slight in aphthous fever, and (e) by the absence of the intense and
subtle infection of aphthous fever, which quickly attacks a whole
herd and extends with equal rapidity over sheep, goats and pigs,
attacking all cloven-footed animals virtually without exception.
The cowpox patient, on the contrary, does not necessarily attack
the cow in the next stall unless milked by the same hands, and
spares heifers, bulls, steers, sheep, goats and pigs.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the <i>rinderpest</i> cutaneous eruption it is easily distinguished
by the presence of lymph in the lesion, that of rinderpest being a
mere epidermic concretion; by the absence of the intense fever,
anorexia and general constitutional disturbance, and of the early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>and high mortality which characterize that disease; by the absence
of rapid and uniform infection of other cattle irrespective of
a common milker; by the immunity of heifers, steers and bulls,
which are speedily prostrated by rinderpest, and by the absence
of the congestions and epithelial concretions of the mucosæ which
characterize rinderpest.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the <i>leg irruption</i> found in animals feeding on distiller’s
swill and grains, or on the mast of beet sugar factories, by the
history of the outbreak, of the dietary, of the seat and nature of
the disease, and by the escape of animals living on a different
aliment.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the <i>false cowpox</i> (varicella) it is distinguished by the
unilocular lesion of the latter, its absence of areola, and its rapid
pustulation and drying, in five or six days into a thin papery
crust instead of a thick, firm, umbilicated scab, as in cowpox.
Varicella is further liable to appear in successive crops and thus
last for several weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>streptococcus eruption</i> on teats and udder, is marked by the
formation of abscesses of various sizes from a simple pustule upward,
by the unilocular condition of the pus sac, by its tendency
to invade the deeper tissues, and by its rupture and granulation
without the formation of the thick umbilicated scab of cowpox.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>hard warty growths</i> on the teats which last for weeks or
months should never be mistaken for cowpox.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cowpox</i> usually lasts for some weeks in a herd, the duration
depending on the number of susceptible animals and, whether
these are habitually milked by the same person.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Course. Prognosis.</i> It is a mild affection, which does not endanger
life, yet it causes considerable loss through diminution of
the milk secretion and, it may be, altered character of the milk,
through the persistent sores and ulcers of the teats, through inflammation
of the mammæ, and through an acquired habit of
kicking.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> is rarely needed. Any costiveness should be corrected
by a cooling saline laxative (½ to 1 lb. Epsom salts) or
by soft food, and milking should be done with great care to prevent
rupture of the vesicles and the formation of sores. A teat
tube may be used if necessary. Sores may be dressed with
bland ointment. An ounce each of spermacetti and sweet almond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>oil with half a dram of gum myrrh. Or the vesicles or sores
may be washed after each milking with a solution of 2 drams
hyposulphite of soda in 1 quart water.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SHEEPPOX. VARIOLA OVINA.</h3>

<p class='c015'><i>Synonyms.</i> Pocks; Peltrot; Clavelee, Picotte, (Fr.).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An acute febrile affection, eminently contagious,
prevailing epizoötically in sheep and goats, characterized by
early and marked hyperthermia, and general constitutional disorder,
followed by the appearance on the bare or merely hairy
portions of the skin, of diffuse redness becoming intensified in
points, a rounded papular eruption, passing into vesicles, pustules
and scabs, which latter dry up and drop off in 15 to 20 days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathogenesis.</i> Beside sheep and goats which contract the disease
by exposure, the following genera have been successfully
inoculated: ox, dog, pig, horse.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Forms.</i> Two typical forms are recognized: (<i>a</i>) the <i>discrete</i>,
<i>regular</i> or <i>benign</i>, in which the vesicles remain relatively few,
and well isolated from each other, and (<i>b</i>) the <i>confluent</i>, <i>irregular</i>
or <i>malignant</i> in which the vesicles are generally diffused over
the body, even on the parts covered by wool, and set so close
together that they merge into each other forming extensive continuous
lesions. Other forms are the <i>hæmorrhagic</i>, <i>purple</i> or
<i>black sheeppox</i>, the volante or intermittent kind, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> Formerly common in Central and
Western Europe, it still prevails continuously in the Balkans,
the Danubian Principalities, Italy, Spain, the South of France
and Algiers. Like other forms of variola, its permanent home is
in Asia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> Long before the advent of modern bacteriology,
sheeppox was held to be always and everywhere the result of
contagion alone. Whenever it entered a new locality it was as
the result of the importation of an affected sheep or one of its
products; insular places like England maintained a permanent
immunity, though the disease prevailed on the other side of the
narrow straits or channel; yet when imported (1847 and 1862)
it demonstrated a general susceptibility of the flocks on exposure
or inoculation; more distant lands (America, Australia, Tasmania,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>South Africa, etc.) in the absence of imported infection remain
clear to the present day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The infection is more intense and diffusible than that of cowpox
and horsepox following in this the smallpox of man. Absolute
contact is not necessary, in either case the infection is carried in
the air either on dust or otherwise, and above all in a confined
building, a crowded sheep fold or a dusty highway.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all forms of variola the virulence is concentrated in the
lymph of the vesicle, and in horsepox and cowpox it is largely
confined to this, whilst in sheeppox in severe cases it must also
at times infect the blood, as lambs are occasionally born with
sheeppox. On this basis the infection of the secretions generally
has been advocated, but it is to be supposed that in moderate
cases these are contaminated after secretion. Nocard and Roux
produced immunity by the transfusion of blood from the sick to
the healthy, but in no case a variolous eruption. Even the serosity
from the swollen lymph glands failed to convey the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>In view of the diffusible nature of the germ, however, we must
recognize that all secretions may be quickly contaminated as soon
as they are exposed, and therefore no product of a sick or suspected
sheep can be held to be safe, and all should be treated as
presumably infected. The most dangerous products and those
most liable to convey the disease are wool, hides, litter, buildings,
yards, covers, parks, railway cars, boats, manure, urine and
milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Living creatures like men, dogs, cats, birds, vermin, flies and
other predacious insects are occasional bearers of infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Receptivity</i> must be considered in every case. In countries and
districts habitually immune from sheeppox, all breeds appear to
be equally susceptible, the only refractory specimens being sheep
that have survived a first attack, and lambs born of ewes that had
the disease (naturally or inoculated) during the later stages of
gestation. New born lambs, on an exclusively milk diet, are
alleged to be somewhat refractory. In a country where sheeppox
has prevailed long and extensively, as in Algiers and Brittany,
certain breeds of sheep seem to have attained to a large measure
of immunity (Nocard). This is doubtless largely due to the survival
of the more insusceptible strains of blood, as Algerian sheep
carried into France lead to most virulent outbreaks among the
native animals (Galtier).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>This relative immunity is still more decided when we come to
animals of other genera. Though the latest results of research
seem to identify the sporidia found in the different forms of
variola, yet the long habit of living in an environment found in
the ovine race unfits the germ for pathogenic life in various other
genera that have their own variolæ. Sacco and Villain reported
inoculations from sheep to man, but as the first was experimenting
with variola at the same time, and the second did not test his
pustules by reinoculation the results are not convincing. Küchenmeister
had a general eruption in sheep after intravenous injection
of variola of man, but failed to test it by reinoculation.
Voisin and Nocard on the other hand were uniformly unsuccessful
in attempts to convey sheeppox to man, and the handling of
variolous flocks from time immemorial must have led to many
cases in man, had he been appreciably receptive. It is virtually
the same with cowpox. Huzard vaccinated 2,000 sheep without
producing immunity from sheeppox. Voisin had precisely similar
results. He further inoculated infants with sheeppox, and later,
successfully, with vaccine lymph.</p>

<p class='c008'>It does not follow that these genera would be insusceptible
under all conditions. Yet the failure to immunize against each
other would argue a wider divergence of sheeppox and cowpox,
than of smallpox and cowpox, or than of bovine and avian
tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Galtier failed to inoculate sheeppox on rabbits or Guinea pigs,
yet Jourdan, records a destructive outbreak in the Alps, in hares,
kept in the same places with variolous sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory External Causes.</i> All unwholesome conditions of
life, and especially overcrowding, filth, starvation, and neglect
contribute to the extension of the infection. Still more so, the
importation of sheep, whether in the parks of armies, or in the
channels of trade, by rail, or steamboat, through stockyards or
markets.</p>

<p class='c008'>The virus is possessed of unusual vitality, and in the dried
condition, secluded from air and light will remain virulent for an
indefinite period. Hence the danger of wool, and dried sheepskins.
Even in the moisture of an ordinary shed it has retained
its infectiveness for five or six months. The sheep that has recovered
from the affection may transmit the disease to others for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>a period of six weeks. The virulence is rapidly destroyed by exposure
to free air and sunshine, by a high temperature (140° F.),
by dilute HCl (2:100), by carbolic acid (2:100), by zinc chloride
(5:100), by potassæ permanganas (10:100), by lime chloride
(4:100), or indeed by any of the strong antiseptics.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> This extends from four to seven days on an
average, with a minimum of two and a maximum of twenty days.
The conditions favoring an early eruption are youth, high condition,
and a hot season, or close warm building, with overcrowding.
Those favoring a tardy eruption are old age, debility, and
above all a cold or wet season with exposure in the open air.
Simonds, who inoculated in England in the cold months (October
and November) never saw it exceed 13 days. In certain cases,
however when the eruption had already commenced in mild
weather, the sudden occurrence of a week of cold and wet,
would stop it short to start anew on the return of warm weather
a week later. In inoculated cases the incubation is shortened,
while it is prolonged when the virus is introduced by the digestive
or respiratory passages.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> During the last two or three days of a prolonged
incubation and especially in old sheep, there may be some impairment
of appetite and rumination, dulness, a stiffness of
movement of the hind limbs, and a disposition to lag behind the
flock. The temperature may even have risen (104.5° F.), yet
Simonds has never seen the febrile symptoms precede the eruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>There follow, trembling, or rigors, accelerated pulse (80 to 90)
and breathing, arched back, anorexia, suspension of rumination,
costiveness, redness of the eyes, epiphora, a watery discharge
from the nose, gradually becoming more viscid, and a marked
hyperthermia (105°, 106° or 107° F.) If the skin is white, a
blush, with some heat, is shown in the seat of the future eruption,
usually on the parts uncovered by wool, the axillæ, sternum,
abdomen, udder, inner sides of the thighs, lower surface of the
tail, and the face—especially the eyelids, nostrils and lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>In two days more, deep red points, like flea bites, appear more
or less numerously, in the congested parts of the skin, and in
twenty-four hours these have increased to firm rounded papules
which are felt to extend into the true skin. These vary in size
from 3 to 12 mm. or more. In two or three days the papule has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>become firmer and less tender, and shows in the centre a paler
area where the exudation has resolved it into a vesicle. The
characteristic sheeppox vesicle is rounded or flattened on its
summit, being rarely pointed as in smallpox, or umbilicated as
in cowpox. It is usually surrounded by a pink zone, which is at
times infiltrated, firm and resistant. After about the sixth day,
the vesicle becomes yellowish from the formation of pus. The
pustules, with the surrounding tumefaction, encrease for about
three days, when if they have not become confluent nor infected,
they begin to dry up, acquiring a grayish crust on the surface
which gradually encreases to a thick scab, which in five or six
days more is detached leaving a pink, pitted spot covered by
forming epidermis. Sometimes no distinct scab forms, but the
crust dries, cracks up, and falls off in scales.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the vesicles do not appear at once, but some earlier and
some later, so that the successive stages of the eruption may be
often seen together on the same subject, and the case is thereby
materially prolonged.</p>

<p class='c008'>As in other forms of variola the hyperthermia usually subsides
with the appearance of the eruption, but as often reappears in
some measure with pustulation (secondary fever of reaction), and
becomes more severe in proportion to the extent and confluence
of the eruption and the occurrence of complex infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The eruption may invade the conjunctiva, the cornea (inducing
blindness), the nasal mucosa (causing difficult breathing),
the mouth (salivation, difficult mastication), the pharynx (difficult
deglutition), the stomach and intestines (diarrhœa), the
bronchia (cough), or the vulva.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the occurrence of desiccation, in discrete cases, the fever
subsides, the swelling of the skin and head disappears, the discharges
from the nose and eyes cease, and the animal is restored
to health.</p>

<p class='c008'>A secondary eruption will sometimes take place, but only
papules form, which disappear without reaching maturity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duration of discrete sheep pox is usually about three
weeks, but it may reach four in cool weather. It is more rapid
and more prone to dangerous complications in hot weather. As
the members of a flock are usually attacked in succession, it may
take three months to pass through a flock.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>In <i>confluent</i> or <i>complicated cases</i> the fever of invasion is very
high, the sheep dull, prostrate, tender to touch along the back
and loins particularly, with hurried, labored, panting, breathing,
and mawkish, fevered breath, the weakness increases rapidly,
standing even may become difficult, the wool is loosened and falls
off in patches, the exposed skin is red, shading, it may be, into a
violet hue. The head droops, the lips and nostrils swell, saliva
drivels abundantly, anorexia is complete, though thirst may be
ardent, a yellowish and even reddish, fœtid discharge may flow
from the nose, respiration is difficult, the eyes are watery and
deeply sunken, and the head, limbs, breast and abdomen are extensively
infiltrated and œdematous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fever does not subside with the occurrence of eruption, which
may appear thickly over the whole body, the woolly parts as well as
the bare or hairy. The vesicles, which have often a dark, unhealthy
look, tend to become confluent, and instead of proceeding regularly
to maturity, they may remain hard or indolent papules or
nodules or blacken and dry up. The secretion, when it takes
place, is liable to be a thick, yellowish, fœtid pus. The eruption
has much more tendency than with the discrete form to invade
mucosæ, and not infrequently the serosæ are involved, especially
those covering the lungs, liver and spleen. In the worst cases
death may result from the fever before any eruption has taken
place, in other cases the extent of the internal lesions tends to
hasten a fatal result. With the amount of care that can be given
to a flock, confluent cases are usually fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>In connection with the itching and scratching of the nose,
abrasions and complex infections ensue, resulting in extensive
ulceration and gangrene implicating the nasal cartilages and
bones. The eruption around the pasterns may lead to shedding
of the hoofs, and sloughing of the whole digital structures. Suppurating
and gangrenous swellings form subcutaneously and in
the lymph glands with fatal results. Blindness is especially
liable to happen from the formation of the eruption on the conjunctiva
and cornea. Ulcerations and sloughs are common on
the internal mucosæ, and even on the serosæ. In implication of
the abdominal organs, a fœtid diarrhœa is usually present, and
in pregnant ewes abortion is the usual result.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The cutaneous lesions are in their multilocular structure,
the same as in cowpox, but differ materially in size and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>form. The typical vesicle is small (5 to 12 mm.), and neither
broad and umbilicated like cowpox, nor conical and pointed as in
smallpox, but round with a slight flattening on the summit. On
the same animal may often be found all the successive stages at
once, red points or hæmorrhagic spots, vesiculation, pustulation
and even desiccation. The early changes are seen in the papillary
layer and rete mucosum, in the form of swelling and congestion
of the papillæ, exudation, active proliferation of the epidermic
and tissue cells, and migration of leucocytes, (embryonic
cells polynuclear) vacuolation of the papule, the spaces being
filled with a straw colored exudate, and finally, the replacing of
this by pus. If the local inflammation is very acute, the pustule
may be resolved into a small abscess. On section of the skin the
affected parts are found to be the seat of congestion and gelatinoid
exudation, extending into the subcutaneous and intermuscular
connective tissue, and even the muscles themselves are blackish
and their capillaries engorged. The exudation is especially abundant
in the dependent parts (head, neck, sternal and abdominal
regions, legs). In proportion to the severity of the attack there
are congestion, exudation, swelling, and blood extravasation in
the lymph glands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nasal mucosa is congested, thickened or even ulcerated
with abundant, tenacious, muco-purulent secretion and the nasal
chambers narrowed or obstructed, and similar changes may be
present in the larynx, trachea and bronchia. Spots of ecchymosis
and even distinct variolous vesicles are to be expected.
The pleuræ are often the seat of congestion, petechiæ, exudation,
and discoloration (red or pale). The lung may show congestion
and hepatisation in circumscribed areas, or there may be on the
surface of such hepatised portions red or grayish foci, like a lentil,
pea or bean, the seat of degeneration or forming minute abscesses.
The pericardium and myocardium may be involved to a limited
extent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The buccal and pharyngeal mucosæ may be the seats of vesicles,
or erosions or ulcers the result of their destruction, and the
gastro-intestinal mucosa presents ecchymoses, vesicles, abrasions,
and open sores in the midst of inflamed catarrhal patches. The
mesenteric and other lymph glands are congested, swollen,
softened and friable. Congestions and petechiæ are found on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>peritoneum, liver, spleen and kidneys, with, at times, nodular
foci. In certain cases congestions and effusions have been found
on the pia mater and arachnoid, in the cerebral ventricles and the
brain substance.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis.</i> <i>Mortality.</i> Mortality varies much with the severity
of the special outbreak and the conditions of life, favorable or
otherwise, in which the flock is placed. In the milder forms
the mortality may not exceed seven per cent, while in the more
violent the whole flock almost may perish. A fatality of 20 to
30 per cent is the general average. Yet the inoculated form kills
but 2 per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'>If at the outset there is great weakness and prostration, complete
anorexia and high fever, the prospect is discouraging. If
the fever is moderate and strength and appetite retained, the case
is very hopeful. On its first advent into a new country it
causes a far greater mortality than after it has been long domiciled
there, and frequent outbreaks have killed off the more susceptible
strains of blood. Again very hot weather, or, still more, the
prevalence of cold, drenching rains aggravates an outbreak
and greatly encreases the fatality.</p>

<p class='c008'>The loss is not to be measured by the deaths alone. The
failure of the crop of lambs, through abortion, the shedding of
wool, the loss of sight, hearing, hoofs, digits, flesh, stamina, etc,
render recovery far from desirable, in the worst cases, as the
animal fails to thrive or pay for its keep. On the contrary it is
immune from any future attack, and if left in a thrifty condition
it becomes especially valuable in a district where sheeppox
prevails.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> Once established in the system the disease will
follow its regular course, through all its stages. Yet we can, by
dieting, pure air, cleanliness, shelter and even by medicinal
measures, do much to render that course a safe one. Cool sheds,
pure air, clean floor, dry clean litter and shelter from rain are
above all important. The sheep may be separated in different
enclosures in small lots of 5 or 6 to prevent crowding, heating,
and excitement, and in any case the infected should be removed
from the noninfected, and even from each other to avoid infection
and reinfection. This is especially requisite in hot weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the strong and vigorous, a diet of sliced roots and meal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>(oat, bran, linseed, barley, wheat middlings) is good, while for
the weak, gruels of oat meal, barley meal, linseed meal, or the
same agents dry, may be given. Powdered saltpeter may be
given in this (1 oz. to 8 or 10 sheep) and common salt allowed to
be licked at will. Drinking water may be given pure, or slightly
acidulated with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, or hyposulphite
or bisulphite of soda may be used as a substitute for the
latter. The bowels are usually costive, and may be relieved at
first by 3 ozs. of sodic sulphate, and later, if need be, by soapy
injections. Often during the course of the disease a sudden
access of fever may be cut short by a mild laxative, if that is not
contra-indicated by existing diarrhœa.</p>

<p class='c008'>Avoid giving heating agents to bring out the eruption. The
severity of any case and the danger of complex infection are
usually in ratio with the extent of the eruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lotions of hyposulphite of soda may be applied to the affected
parts from the first, and even weak lotions of chloride of zinc
after the maturation of the pustules. For the eyes, nose and
mouth antiseptic lotions may be called for.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the advanced stages, in weak subjects, tonics and stimulants
may prove useful. To the mineral acid, quinine (10 grain doses)
or gentian (drachm doses) or other bitter may be added for valuable
stock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Treatment is only permissible in the case of very valuable
animals and when they are surrounded with the most perfect
antiseptic precautions, to prevent the escape of the infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> As in all dangerous infections this must be the
preëminent object, and when a new country has been invaded by
the disease, no sentiment nor alleged value of affected or exposed
animals should be made the warrant for treatment, nor stand in
the way of the extinction of the plague by the most rigorous
measures. The recovery of an individual flock is never to be put
in the balance with the danger to which other flocks are thereby
exposed. To avoid smuggling away of exposed animals, and
consequent spread of the disease, the loss should be met by the
commonwealth and no foolish idea of administrative economy,
should tempt a stock owner to endanger the flocks of a whole
nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sheep and goats from countries where sheeppox exists should
be absolutely excluded. If, in exceptional cases they are allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>to land on our shores, they should be guaranteed by a veterinary
certificate as coming from a noninfected district, by a route free
of infection, they should be critically examined by an expert on
arrival, and if passed, should still with all clothing and utensils,
be subjected to thorough disinfection. The clothing of attendants
should be similarly dealt with. If importation is merely across a
frontier, a quarantine of 21 days followed by a disinfectant bath
should be enforced.</p>

<p class='c008'>If sheeppox has gained a footing in a flock in a new country,
the flock should be at once appraised and destroyed, and the place
thoroughly disinfected and shut up for three months. All cars,
ships, wharfs, landings, chutes, yards, buildings, parks, roads,
etc., used by them should be closed and thoroughly disinfected.
All flocks exposed to any such place or thing should be placed in
strict quarantine for three weeks, under official veterinary supervision
and disposed of, should they become affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an alternative each infected and suspected flock should be
secluded in a well fenced place or shed from which all men except
the necessary attendants, all dogs and other mammals, including
vermin, all birds and as far as possible all flies are excluded.
They should be divided into small lots of 5 or 6 placed in separate
pens, their temperatures should be taken 3 or 4 times a day, and
any one showing a temperature of 104° or 105° F. should be
instantly removed to a separate pen, and destroyed as soon as the
disease can be identified. In this way a diseased sheep can usually
be removed before it has infected its fellows, and at the worst the
infection will rarely spread beyond the 5 or 6 animals enclosed in
the pen where the first case appeared. It is well to sprinkle the
wool of all the flock with a 5 per cent solution of carbolic acid,
and the floor or ground with chloride of lime. The diseased carcasses
should be thoroughly sterilized by burning, boiling, or immersion
in strong acids, or they should be deeply buried, the infected
pen disinfected on each occasion, and the hands and clothes
of the attendants purified.</p>

<p class='c008'>Careful treatment in this way will usually cut short the disease
with the loss of those only that were already infected when the
outbreak was taken in hand, but it must be in the hands of men
who are at once experts and vigilant and trustworthy. The English
invasion of 1862, under the direction of the late Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Gamgee, was completely stamped out in four weeks on this plan,
whereas the invasion of 1847, met by the expedients of inoculation
and quarantine, lasted for four years, with great losses in a
number of flocks, and a very heavy bill for continued expert
supervision. This should be a wholesome lesson to the American
legislators who consider the prompt extinction of infection, by
abolishing this source of its increase in the living body, as a
wasteful outlay.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Preventive Inoculation, Ovination.</i> If it were possible to give
immunity against sheeppox by inoculation with the exudate of
cowpox, and without danger to the sheep from fatal cowpox, or
from its transformation into the more destructive sheeppox, it
would be a most desirable resource. But experiment goes to
show that vaccination is useless, in the temperate climates at
least. Sacco, Hussan, Buniva and others in Italy vaccinated
sheep extensively and claimed to have obtained good results, but
this has not been endorsed by subsequent observers. D’Arboval
vaccinated 1,523 sheep, of which 1,341 contracted cowpox, and
out of 429 of these exposed to sheeppox later, 308 contracted the
latter disease. Ceely vaccinated two sheep, both of which afterward
had mild sheeppox through inoculation. Simonds and
Marson vaccinated 306 sheep, 112 of them successfully, and of
these last two-thirds contracted cowpox a second time on re-vaccination.
Twenty-nine of the successfully vaccinated sheep were
inoculated with sheeppox lymph, and in every case successfully.
It is obvious that vaccination, as a protective measure, is absolutely
untrustworthy in France or in England. Under the warm
skies of Italy, as in Persia, there may be a close relationship between
the two diseases, yet in Italy sheeppox was constantly
prevalent, and it is to be feared that the immunity in a number
of cases was due to a previous attack of that disease rather than
to the vaccination. It should be noted that in Persia sheeppox is
said to be communicable to man, while in England, Ceely failed
to transmit it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ceely suggested variolisation with human smallpox as a preventive
of sheeppox, but Simonds and Marson failed to convey
smallpox to the sheep, though the same animal readily contracted
sheeppox. One can hardly contemplate Ceely’s proposal with
equanimity. Immunity for sheep would be dearly bought at the
cost of a general diffusion of smallpox virus.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span><i>Ovination</i> or inoculation with the lymph of sheeppox is the
only available method of immunization. It entails, however, an
extraordinary multiplication of the virus in each inoculated animal,
and considering the numerous loopholes for its possible diffusion
it can only be looked on as a very dangerous and usually,
in the long run, a very expensive resort. The experience of
England, above referred to, is eloquent in witnessing against
ovination, and “in Prussia and Austria the dissemination of
sheeppox went hand in hand with inoculation.”—Friedberger and
Fröhner.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand <i>ovination</i> is not fatal to the flock operated
on. The mortality is often below 1 percent., and virtually never
exceeds 4, with a general average of about 2 per cent. It is this
comparative impunity of the inoculated flock which closes the eyes
of most persons to the great danger to a whole country and the
wasteful prodigality of the operation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Ovination</i> further shortens the duration of the outbreak in a
large flock, passing all through the disease in 21 days, whereas
as contracted by simple exposure, the duration of the outbreak
may last 90 days or more. It further enables the owner to give
such protection, shelter and care as will guard the flock against
exposure and dangerous complications. But while preferable to the
abandoning of the disease to its natural course, it is always to be
strongly condemned, where it is possible to adopt the method which
detects the sick animal in the incipient stage by thermometry, and
does away with the infection by its removal, followed by disinfection.
The only excuse for ovination is the general prevalence
of sheeppox on an island or other secluded district where there is
no great added danger from the further diffusion of the virus,
and when its simultaneous practice over the whole region can be
made the basis for universal disinfection and the definite extinction
of the contagium.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Technique of Ovination.</i> The lymph (“ovine”) should be
taken from a mild case of the disease, and from a vesicle at full
maturity (about the 6th day), but containing as yet a clear,
translucent exudate, without turbidity or other indication of formation
of pus, or other infection. Inoculation is made by preference
on the bare lower surface of the tail near its tip or 3 to 4
inches behind the anus. If this is unsuitable, the inner side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>the ear, an inch from the tip is usually selected, though there is
here an added element of danger, owing to its proximity to the
eye. The insertion is made with an ordinary suture needle,
which is introduced obliquely under the epidermis about one line,
and pressed upon with the thumb as it is withdrawn. A still
better instrument is the inoculation needle or lancet with a groove
or spoonlike hollow on one side. Or the skin may be scratched or
abraded with the lancet, as in vaccination, until serum oozes,
when the virus is rubbed on and the part is covered with a piece
of sticking plaster. On the third or fifth day the flock is again
examined and those that have failed to <i>take</i> are ovinated anew.</p>

<p class='c008'>The virus is most conveniently taken direct from the affected
sheep, but it may be preserved in capillary tubes, or on glass or
ivory points, or mixed with glycerine between glass plates, or
finally, the first scab well dried may be preserved and utilized, a
minute portion being inserted with the lancet in a pocket made
under the epidermis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Attempts have been made to secure a mitigated and safer virus,
by diluting the lymph with water or normal salt solution (1:50–150)
(Peuch), by amputating the seat of inoculation (the tip of
the ear) on the 4th or 7th day, when the vesicle is formed (Galtier),
by taking a susceptible sheep and inoculating it with sheeppox
virus for ten consecutive days, and then selecting for use the
lymph from the papule of the sixth inoculation. The inoculations
of the seventh day and later give rise to no papule even
(Pourquier). By this means it is claimed that the inoculated disease
remains strictly local, passes through its successive stages in
a shorter time (15 days or less), and is perfectly harmless to the
sheep inoculated. Nocard and Mollereau sought the same end
by mixing the virus with oxygenated water, and Semmer and
Raupach by heating it to 130° F. In view of the facts that it is
only under extraordinary conditions that ovination is permissible
at all, and that the mortality, resulting from it can be kept down
to about 1 per cent., it seems hardly worth while to attempt to
obviate this loss, by any method which may come short of the
full measure of immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ovination confers immunity for a year or longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The care of the flock during eruption is the same as in sheeppox
contracted in the usual way.</p>

  <h3 class='c009'>SHEEPPOX IN GOAT. VARIOLA CAPRINA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The goat can be successfully inoculated from the sheep, the
resulting vesicles being smaller and less prominent, and the disease
assuming a milder type. It is alleged to pass naturally
from sheep to goat, and from goat to sheep, as well as from goat
to goat but, on the whole, it is a rare disease and goats have
been known to live in flocks of sheep attacked with sheeppox,
without themselves contracting the disease. The malady seems
to be of little account to the goat, yet in sheep countries, the interests
of flockmasters would demand that it should be stamped
out as vigorously as the same disease in sheep.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GOATPOX; VARIOLA CAPRINA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In Persia according to Bruce goats suffer from a form of
variola, having larger vesicles, umbilicated and approximating
to, if not identical with cowpox. In Algiers there is found a
goatpox from which sheep are alleged to be immune (Nocard,
Peuch, Bremond, Galtier) so that further observations are
wanted to put the different forms of variola of the goat in their
proper places. In a country where sheeppox is constantly
present, there is of course the possible source of fallacy of experimenting
with animals that have already had the disease,
therefore it would be expedient to put all forms of goat variola
under police control.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SWINEPOX. VARIOLA SUILLA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Variola appears to be rather more frequent in swine than in
goats. Ficanus as quoted by Joubert saw it in 1567, contracted
it was supposed from smallpox patients. It was noted by Ramazini
in 1690, by Stegman in 1697, and later by Gerlach and others.
In 1891 517 cases were reported in Hungary. It is said to be
derived from man by the use of bed straw for litter and from
sheep by occupying the same stall. It can be transmitted experimentally
from pig to pig, from pigs to goats, and from goats
back to pigs (Gerlach). It is also claimed to pass from the pig
to man (Freidberger and Fröhner). Young pigs are especially
subject to it and one attack confers immunity for the future.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span><i>Symptoms.</i> After a febrile condition of variable length, but
usually of a high intensity, red spots appear on the head, neck,
chest, belly or inside the arms and thighs, at first like flea bites,
but passing through the stage of papule to become vesicular on
the sixth day. About the ninth or tenth day they become
purulent, and in two or three days more a black, concave,
circular crust has formed which is soon detached. The eruption
may be <i>local</i> or <i>general</i>, <i>discrete</i> or <i>confluent</i> and the issue of the
case will depend much on this character. In exceptional cases
the eruption invades the mouth, eye, throat, stomach, or intestines.
Croker notes the accompaniment of a fatal lobular
catarrhal pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be carefully distinguished from urticaria, eczema, and
eruptions due to pustulating irritants.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> is in the main the same as for sheep, care being
taken to secure perfect cleanliness, pure air, dry clean litter,
easily digested food, and protection from crowding, undue heat,
cold or wet. Buttermilk and other acidulous and diuretic drinks
are recommended, and careful attention to the state of the bowels
throughout.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention</i> is still more important, and better than any treatment
would be the most rigorous measures for its extinction
along the lines laid down for sheep pox. Whether the infection
has been derived from man or sheep it must be looked on as
eminently dangerous to the class of animal from which it
originated, and every available means used for its extinction.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>DOG POX: VARIOLA CANINA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Dog pox is rare, the affection occurring especially in the
young. It is said to be derived in certain cases from smallpox
patients (Weiskopf), and in others from sheep pox (Röll). The
latter claims that the dog has also its own specific form.
Dupuis and others claim experimental transmission from man to
dog. At the same time eruptions connected with gastric or
hepatic disorder, distemper, eczema, or aphthous fever are liable
to be mistaken for it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The young animals suffer from fever for a day or
two, followed by heat and redness on the sides and belly, and
points of deeper red, like flea bites, which gradually evolve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>through papules and vesicles to pustules, and terminate in crusts,
that drop off leaving round bare spots. The vesicles may
appear locally or generally and may be discrete or confluent.
Sucking puppies, when attacked usually perish.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>treatment</i> the same hygienic measures are demanded as for
other animals, special care being required to keep the bowels and
kidneys acting in a healthy manner. Perfect cleanliness must be
secured, and nonstimulating easily digested food. Excessive
fever would demand tepid baths, cold sponging, or acetanilid,
and undue warmth, crowding and cold exposure must be alike
guarded against.</p>

<p class='c008'>In view of the alleged sources of the disease in man and sheep,
the strictest seclusion of the affected dog, in disinfected surroundings
will become absolutely essential and when this cannot be
carried out he should be summarily destroyed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>VESICULAR EXANTHEMA OF HORSES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Definition</i>: Vesicles usually on external genitals, with fever and infection.
Causes: Contagion by coition, clothing or stable utensils; inoculated
on man or cow, resembles cowpox, but a first attack does not always
immunize a stallion; inoculable on sheep, goat and pig. Symptoms:
Incubation one to six days; local redness, heat, swelling, tenderness,
papule, vesicle, pustule, scab, desquamation, depigmentation on genitals
or in sucklings on mouth, lips, nose; may extend to mammary and inguinal
regions, with swelling, stiffness and constitutional disturbance. Diagnosis
from dourine. Treatment: Cleanliness, astringent, antiseptic lotions; open
and disinfect abscesses; laxatives or diuretics. Prevention: Withhold from
breeding.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> An acute infectious disease, manifested by hyperthermia,
hyperæmia, and the formation usually on the external
generative organs of a crop of papules rapidly progressing to
vesicles, pustules and open sores, and attended by great local
irritation and itching. It runs a mild course and recovery ensues
spontaneously in about fifteen days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The disease is only known as a contagious affection,
propagated from animal to animal by breeding together, or by
using the same comb, brush or rubber, or by sucking, and in rare
cases by other accidental or experimental inoculations. To make
a successful inoculation the virus must be taken from the vesicles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>or pustules. When transferred to man or ox it develops an
eruption which is indistinguishable from cowpox (Trasbot,
Peuch, Galtier). Still a first attack does not always confer immunity,
as stallions may have two successive attacks within a
few weeks (Steinhoff). This implies that either this is not genuine
cowpox, as claimed in France, or that two different exanthematous
affections have been classed as one. Inoculation with
the virus has produced a characteristic eruption in sheep, goats
and pigs.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> After a period of incubation of from one to six
days there appear heat, swelling and tenderness of the affected
part, followed by the formation of papules, gradually passing
into vesicles, pustules and scabs which scale off, leaving a white
depigmented surface. In stallions and mares the usual seat of
the eruption is the external generative organs; in young sucking
animals the mouth, lips, nose and quarters, and in inoculated
cases wherever the virus has been implanted.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>mare</i> there is swelling of the lips of the vulva and
redness of the vaginal and vulvar mucosa with points of a
darker red, which become firm, papular, vesicular and finally
pustular. A similar eruption shows on the skin of the swollen
labiæ, on the lower surface of the tail and on the hips, though
on these points the phenomena are obscured somewhat by the
abundance of pigment. The contents of the vesicles are at first
limpid but gradually change to opaque yellowish white, brown,
or even red from slight blood extravasation. It causes not only
marked tenderness but great itching so that the patient rubs the tail
and rump, rupturing the vesicles, causing blood extravasations
and retarding healing. The sores are primarily two or three lines
in diameter but may widen and deepen under the friction. The
surface may be red and angry and covered by a yellowish viscid
discharge. When they heal they leave on the dark skin, round
spots white and devoid of pigment. The itching during the
acute stage of the disease, leads to generative excitement, frequent
straining, contractions of the erector clitoris and ejection
of urine. The animal appears to be constantly in heat, yet the
absence of hyperthermia shows that there is no constitutional
disorder nor central nervous affection. The disease appears to
be purely local.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>In the <i>stallion</i> after a similar incubation, the penis and usually
the sheath become swollen and congested and if free from pigment
there are dark points as described in the vulva. These
points become firm, prominent, and finally vesicular and pustular.
If continued in service the resulting sores may extend and prove
protracted. In the absence of service they tend to heal about the
fifteenth day. The eruption may extend on the scrotum, the
inner side of the thighs, the throat, the lower surface of the
neck, and the inside of the forelegs; on any parts indeed that
may become soiled on mounting the mare. The meatus urinarius
is red, swollen and angry, and shows a muco-purulent discharge.
Generative excitement is shown by the more frequent rising and
falling of the testicles, protrusion and retraction of the penis,
and the frequency of urination.</p>

<p class='c008'>In bad cases in both sexes the eruption encroaches more widely
on the skin, and subcutaneous abscesses may form on the vulva,
anus, tail, between the thighs or on the scrotal, mammary or
inguinal regions. These are attended by extensive local swellings
extending on the croup, or down to the hock, or forward to the
hind limbs. In such cases there is more or less stiffness or
lameness, with constitutional disturbance, hyperthermia, gastric
disorder and emaciation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> This disease is distinguished from dourine by the
known absence of the latter from the locality, by the ready
transmission, of the benign exanthema to cattle, by the entire
absence of paresis or mental hebetude, by its rapid progress and
early recovery, usually in fifteen days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> consists in thorough cleanliness, and the application
of cooling, astringent, antiseptic lotions to the affected parts.
Solutions of borax, boric acid, sulphate or chloride of zinc, permanganate
of potash, corrosive sublimate, chlorine water, creolin,
lysol, carbolic acid, or other such agent with glycerine will act
promptly and well. In the severe cases with secondary abscesses
the latter must be opened and the cavities treated antiseptically.
Cooling laxatives and diuretics with salicylates or hyposulphites
may also be desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> No animal having sores nor discharge from the
generative organs should be used for breeding. The owner of
the animal infected by breeding has a good claim for damages.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VESICULAR EXANTHEMA IN CATTLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Definition: acute infections, eruptive affection, usually of the genitals, in
cattle, transmitted by breeding, and marked by congestion, papules, vesicles
and pustules. Cause: infection by coition; by contact, by gutter, by
tail, by licking, in sucklings. Oxen and non-pregnant cows suffer. Symptoms:
incubation 1 to 6 days, cows have swelling, red points, papules, vesicles
and pustules on vulvar mucosa and adjoining skin, with profuse glairy
discharge, and it may be fever: bull has matting of preputial hairs, frequent
micturition, swollen sheath, red penis, vesicles, even necrotic ulcers and
distortion. Immunization short, uncertain. Treatment as in horse. Prevention:
seclusion and disinfection of animals, disinfection of stalls, gutters,
rubbing posts, trees, complete segregation of sick from healthy.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> An acute eruptive affection, attacking particularly
the generative organs of breeding cattle, manifested by congestion,
papules, vesicles and pustules of the mucosa and skin and
transmitted largely by copulation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The one known cause is infection and the most common
mode of communicating it is by the generative act. In this it
agrees with the mild coital exanthema of horses, and the two affections
have been considered as identical with each other and
with cowpox (Trasbot). The similarity of the symptoms and
the duration of the disease sustain this view, but, if correct, it is
probable that the affection has undergone a distinct modification
which adapts the microbe especially to life in the genital canal,
and to the maintenance of its virulence for a longer period, and
finally, robs it of the power of producing any permanent immunity.
Cowpox, though raised on the lips of the vulva, the
inner side of the thighs and the abdomen where it can be easily
reached by the tail does not tend to implicate the genital canal,
and it so quickly secures immunity, that neither male nor female
would be likely to long convey the disease. Yet in both horses
and cattle experience shows that the acquired immunity of vesicular
exanthema is very short lived.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cattle, much more than horses, are liable to transmission of
the disease by other channels than coition. Contact with the
same soiled stall and gutter, the direct transference to adjoining
animals by the soiled tail, and the greater frequency with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>they lick themselves and others doubtless contribute to this. The
frequency of non-coital infection is shown in Numann’s cases affecting
the anus and sheath in oxen; also in Fenner’s long list
of cases in 669 non-pregnant cows, in a number of cows in advanced
pregnancy and in calves of a few weeks old (Friedberger
and Fröhner).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms. In Cows.</i> After an incubation of one to six, (or
exceptionally ten) days, there occur swelling and redness of the
lips of the vulva, and the vaginal mucosa with here and there
dark red points, and an abundant clear, glairy discharge. The
red points may become firm and papular, and an exudate beneath
the epithelium transforms them into vesicles at first translucent
but later yellow or brown as pus cells accumulate. The clear
mucous discharge meanwhile becomes opaque and, as the pustules
open, forming sores, yellowish and purulent. This discharge
soils the tails and hips, drains out on the back part of the stall
and the gutters and is carried by the tail to the udder and to
other stock. Itching may be severe and the constant rubbing
and switching of the tail, may irritate the sores and cause them
to deepen or extend, beside favoring septic infection and local
necrotic processes. In such cases there may be more or less
fever, impairment of appetite, rumination and digestion, and of
the secretion of milk. Abortion is not unknown though exceptional.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms. In Bull.</i> The matting together of the long hairs
of the prepuce may be the first indication of the disease, attended
or followed by frequent micturition, or by standing with the tail
raised and the accelerator urinæ pulsating over the ischiatic arch
as if passing urine. The sheath appears swollen, the penis red
granular, and angry, with red spots, and even the scrotum may
be involved in the enlargement. The red points advance as in
the female through the different forms of papule, vesicle and
pustule to the formation of sores which are more or less red and
angry. There may be an indisposition or even inability to protract
the penis, and the bull may be tardy to serve, or in case the
organ is erected and used, blood may ooze from the respective
sores. The disease usually lasts about two weeks, but may
recur a few weeks later in connection with a new infection. In
aggravated and prolonged cases there may be local septic and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>necrotic processes, and general fever and digestive disturbances.
Distortions of the penis may render the subject permanently useless
as a sire.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> is essentially the same as in the horse. Antiseptic and
astringent solutions (sulphate of zinc, iron or copper (2:100), nitrate
of silver, carbolic acid, corrosive sublimate, lysol, creolin,
etc.) may be used to advantage. Laxatives and diuretics may be
called for.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> This would require the temporary seclusion and
final disinfection of all animals attacked, the thorough cleansing
and disinfection of the stalls and gutters, as well as all posts,
trees and fences on which the animals rub themselves. The attendants
should use no combs, brushes, sponges nor rubbers indiscriminately
on the sick and healthy. They should disinfect
their hands and, if necessary, their clothes after having handled
the sick and before handling or milking sound animals. An
obvious precaution is to place the sick and healthy in separate
buildings and yards.</p>

of fold. Treatment: antiseptics to mouth; borax, sulphites,
chlorate of potash, sodium salicylate, iron chloride, copperas, silver nitrate.
Feed through tube or syringe. Internally, sulphites.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is found in all parts of France, as described by Besnoit.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The predisposition, as in the case of many other fatal
internal inflammations, depends largely on faulty hygiene, foul,
ill ventilated, hot, close, damp, overcrowded folds, without sunshine,
drainage or free access to the outer air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>specific cause</i> is a large coccus, isolated or in chains of 2, 3,
4 or more (streptococcus), and found abundantly in the pultaceous
buccal exudate, and in the internal lesions developed by autoinfection.
It grows readily in bouillon in the form of a precipitate
in the bottom of the liquid, in gelatine and glucose in very small,
thin colonies, and on potato in creamy masses. It is stained by
anilin and by Gram’s (iodine) preparation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathogenesis.</i> Inoculable on the Guinea pig, it is harmless to
the rabbit. It is readily conveyed to lambs and kids by inoculation,
or through the teats, by licking, drinking, feeding, etc.
Acute cases are very virulent, subacute very little so. Isolated
cases of the latter are not uncommon.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The buccal lesions are like those of <i>thrush</i> (<i>muguet</i>).
The mucosa is more or less congested and reddened with raised
patches, of varying extent, of white, curdy looking concretions,
composed of excess of epithelial cells and leucocytes with an
abundant exudate. The specific coccus is present in great numbers
and often in almost pure cultures. The internal lesions
found in the more acute and fatal cases are mostly in the form of
gastro-enteritis, hepatitis and pneumonia, containing the specific
cocci, and due to the inhalation or swallowing of the virulent
buccal products.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> In the <i>acute cases</i> an intense hyperthermia is the
first symptom, speedily followed by refusal to suck, the accumulation
of froth around the lips, great dulness and lassitude, prostration,
rapidly advancing debility, and emaciation, and death in
15 days in a condition of marasmus and inanition. When the
mouth is opened the curdy white or yellowish white patches of
exudation are seen with an abundant glairy mucus, and occasionally
red, raw, angry patches from which the morbid growth has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>been detached. The symptoms of pneumonia or of muco-enteritis
are usually in evidence, with or without diarrhœal or dysenteric
discharges. Acute cases are extremely contagious.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>subacute cases</i> the lesions are confined to the buccal mucosa,
as curdy white, raised concretions with ulcerous surfaces, frothy
lips and refusal of the teat, but without marked hyperthermia or
constitutional disturbance. Contagion is little marked, the disease
appearing enzoötically in flocks, or even as but one case in
each of several flocks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality.</i> Eight per cent. of acute cases may perish, but the
subacute nearly all recover.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> When the disease has appeared in a flock, or in
its vicinity, the mouths of the lambs should be examined daily
and affected subjects and their dams carefully separated. A
thorough disinfection of the fold is imperative.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> Use antiseptics on the mouth, selecting the non-poisonous
articles. Borax may be rubbed freely on the patches.
Solutions of sulphite, bisulphite or hyposulphite of soda (1 oz.
to 1 qt.) may be used at frequent intervals on the mouth; chlorate
of potash (5:100), sodium salicylate (1:100), iron chloride
(1:100) may be used. Ulcerous patches may be cauterized by
iron sulphate, silver nitrate, or the potential cautery. Besnoit
advises mercuric chloride (1:1,000) for cutaneous lesions, but
this would be unsuitable for either mouth or lips. The strength
must be sustained by the dam’s milk given through a tube or
syringe. For gastric lesions the sulphites may be given.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> The premature expulsion of the product of conception
before it is viable out of the womb. Strictly speaking, a parturition
in which the offspring is so far matured as to be <i>viable</i> is
a <i>premature parturition</i>, while if it is <i>non-viable</i> it is an <i>abortion</i>.
Vulgarly, however, as applied to herds, the term is used for any
early parting with the fœtus. In this wider sense infectious
abortion is <i>the premature expulsion of the fœtus owing to an infectious
catarrh of the womb, transmitted from one animal to another
by the transference of the microbe</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Synonyms.</i> Infectious Abortion, Enzoötic Abortion, Epizoötic
Abortion.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals Affected.</i> Abortion is most common in cows, and less
frequent in ewes, goats, sows and mares.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Forms and Accessory Causes of Abortion.</i> It was formerly supposed
that abortion in herds was mainly due to mechanical and
chemical agencies acting injuriously on the system, and in adopting
the explanation of a particulate, transferrable, infectious
agent for the habitual widespread forms of the disease, we should
not forget these accessory causes, many of which by themselves
cause sporadic abortions without the intervention of an infectious
element.</p>

<p class='c008'>The free <i>consumption of ice cold water</i> by the healthy dam
causes active gastro-intestinal peristalsis and vigorous movements
of the advanced fœtus, which can be seen or felt in the right
flank, so that this is often resorted to, to determine whether the
animal is pregnant or not. If this is frequently repeated or carried
to excess in susceptible animals it will at times cause abortions.
As in all other cases of mechanical or physiological disturbance,
this is most operative at those periods of constitutional
changes, which if the animal had been unimpregnated would
have brought about ovulation and œstrum.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>The greedy ingestion of <i>cold aliments</i>, like <i>frozen roots</i>, or green
vegetation covered with <i>hoar frost</i>, may have a similar action,
the more so that such aliments are extremely fermentescible and
liable to cause tympany and undue pressure on the gravid womb.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even without ingestion, exposure to <i>cold rain or snow storms</i>
or the <i>plunging in ice cold water</i> tends to produce excessive peristalsis
and fœtal movements and thereby prove injurious.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mechanical injuries</i> to the abdomen as <i>crushing by a gate</i>, <i>kicks</i>,
<i>hooking with horns or tusks</i>, <i>hounding with dogs</i>, <i>riding of each
other when a cow is in heat</i>, are liable to produce congestions, detachment
of fœtal membranes, and even death of the fœtus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very <i>fermentescible foods</i> like those following a wet season or
<i>bad harvest</i>, or those made of the leafy albuminous plants like
lucerne (alfalfa), sainfoin and clover, act injuriously in the way
of causing tympanies and compressions, but it must also be recognized
that we are here dealing with fodders abounding in bacterial
ferments, and that some of their products may act physiologically
as ecbolics, even if the bacteria themselves do not colonize
the genital passages as infections.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Insufficient food</i> or very <i>innutritious forage</i>, too <i>close stabling</i>,
<i>heavy milking</i>, <i>early breeding</i> (dam or sire), <i>inbreeding</i>, are
liable to lower the general stamina and throw the system more
open to the action of other factors.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stagnant</i>, <i>corrupt drinking water</i> has been charged with causing
abortion, and the trouble has ceased when it has been withdrawn,
but it is difficult to estimate its value in different cases—disturbing
digestion, fermentation, poisoning, or introducing of
actual infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Ergoted grasses</i> and <i>smut</i> in maize, wheat or oats, have been often
charged with wide spread abortions, and though each has in turn
been administered in large and continuous doses without causing
abortion, this does not invalidate the many cases in which it manifestly
had that effect, nor does it show that obstetricians have been
mistaken in their almost immemorial trust in ergot as an ecbolic.
It must be recognized, however, that grown under different conditions,
of sunshine and shade, and harvested at different stages
of its development, ergot varies greatly in its physiological action,
as it does also from having been overkept and thus one specimen
is effective or dangerous while another is absolutely ineffective.
The specific action of the alkaloids in determining contraction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>involuntary muscular fibre, is seen alike when used medicinally
and when acting as an accidental toxic agent in causing spasms,
nervous torpor or paralysis, delirium; gangrene of the feet, tail
or tip of the ear; or contraction of the womb and expulsion of its
contents. Like other agents mentioned ergot is at times an active
ecbolic when coöperating with other similarly operating agencies.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Irritant vegetables</i> of various kinds are to be dreaded. Such as
act on the bowels and kidneys, keeping up a constant diarrhœa
and diuresis, are quite liable to cause abortion in susceptible subjects.
<i>Savin</i>, <i>tansy</i> and <i>rue</i> have obtained a bad reputation in
this sense.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cotton root bark</i> is an active ecbolic, but is not likely to harm
animals unless deliberately administered.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Impaction of the rumen or manifolds</i>, and <i>obstinate constipation</i>
with the resulting straining or compression must be named as an
accessory cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>Severe <i>constitutional diseases</i>, especially the infectious fevers,
<i>aphthous fever</i>, <i>lung plague</i>, <i>rinderpest</i>, etc., are occasional causes
of abortion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be brought about by direct irritation of the womb, as
in <i>ovariotomy</i> or <i>dilatation of the cervix</i>, or again by <i>death of the
fœtus</i> through <i>twisting of the umbilical cord</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where cattle are subjected to dry winter feeding, in the absence
of ensilage or roots, on the magnesian limestones, small
<i>calculi in the kidney</i> are almost the rule in winter and the irritation
caused by these conduces to abortion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor must mental influence be altogether ignored. Cows and
even mares are exceedingly sensitive to the smells of <i>decomposing
animal matter</i>, as seen every day in the vicinity of <i>abattoirs</i>, or in
case the <i>carcass</i> of one of their fellows has been opened, and not
infrequently in connection with <i>carrion</i>, and the occurrence of
abortions after such excitement has been frequently noticed.
Cases are on record of specially susceptible cows having had
active labor pains, from being with another cow at the time of
parturition. Shepherds have noticed that violent thunder storms
have been followed by numerous abortions in the flocks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The Contagious Form.</i> Any of the usual causes of sporadic or
accidental abortion may coöperate with the true infectious element
and give unusual energy to it, yet it is of the utmost importance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>to recognize the contagion as the essential cause in all
cases in which it is present. This can usually be done by a careful
inquiry into the history of the outbreak.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a herd has been continuously healthy up to the date of
the introduction of a cow brought from a herd where abortion
has been prevailing, and when following her arrival, one after
another of the original members of the herd abort, without any
apparent cause in the way of change of feed, water, barn, stalls,
or general management, the evidence of the introduction of contagion
by the cow in question is very circumstantial and forcible.
If pregnant cows standing next to the new cow, or near to her,
abort, the argument for contagion is still further corroborated.
If the trouble continues in the herd year after year, attacking
fresh animals some months after their purchase, the case becomes
still stronger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or if a cow from a healthy herd is sent to a bull, that has been
allowed to serve an aborting cow, and if the resulting pregnancy
in the first cow is terminated by abortion, and if this is followed
by successive abortions in the previously healthy herd, we may
reasonably conclude that we are dealing with the infectious form.
If no other appreciable cause for the trouble can be found we
may reasonably conclude that this was the channel for infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or a bull is brought from a herd where abortions have taken
place, and some time after his arrival, the cows of the previously
sound herd begin to abort, the first cases being in those that the
new bull has served. The occurrence is manifestly the result of
contagion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or a newly purchased cow aborts, and is disposed of in consequence,
and another cow, placed in the same stall, in due time
aborts also, and others follow in succession, especially those that
stood next or near to the stall in question. Everything points to
an introduced infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>An indefinite number of other exemplary cases might be
adduced, each varying from the last, but all agreeing in this, that
the evidence of infection stands out prominently and unmistakably.
The infecting material may have been carried by the tail, tongue,
soiled stall, gutter, rubbing post, fence or other object, yet the
fact of contagion can be demonstrated with reasonable certainty.</p>

<p class='c008'>These conclusions have been repeatedly affirmed by actual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>experimental transmission. The Scottish abortion committee
found that healthy pregnant cows often escape, though standing
near or even next to an aborting one, but that when a piece of
cotton wool was inserted into the vagina of an aborting cow for
twenty minutes and then transferred to that of a healthy one, the
latter invariably aborted. Galtier found that when the infecting
vaginal mucus of the aborting cow was transferred to the same
passage of the healthy pregnant one, abortion took place in the
latter. He succeeded in conveying the disease in this way from
cow to sow, ewe, goat, rabbit and Guinea pig, and found that
growth in the body of the rodent intensified its virulence, so that
it could then be successfully inoculated on the mare, bitch and cat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bang subjected two cows, from healthy herds and three months
pregnant, to repeated injections of the products of the culture of his
abortion bacillus in serum glycerine bouillon. Three injections
were made on April 14, May 23 and June 4, and on June 24 one
cow aborted. The other sickened and when killed was found to
carry a dead fœtus. Pure cultures of the abortion bacillus were
found in the fœtal membranes and liquids of both animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Casual Infections.</i> In a case which came under the observation
of the present writer, a family cow kept in a barn where no
abortion had previously occurred, was taken for service to a bull
in a herd where abortion was prevailing, and though she was
only present at the latter place for a few minutes, she aborted in
the sixth month.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another cow from the same aborting herd, was taken into
another herd at a distance of two miles, where abortion had been
unknown up to that time, and some months later the cow standing
in the stall next to her aborted. The remainder of this herd
was sold soon after, so that the further progress of the disease was
not traced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tobiassen quotes the case of a cow from an aborting herd, which
calved a fortnight before the regular time. The calf was at once
sent to another farm where no abortion had occurred, and placed
in the same building with the pregnant cows, all of which later
aborted. The outbreak thus started lasted for several years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jansen as quoted by Sand, reports the case of a cow from an
aborting herd having been taken into a herd that had been previously
quite free from the disease. Soon after her arrival she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>aborted, and later, cows in the same herd aborted. The owner
kept the matter secret and sent his cows to a neighbor’s bull for
service, with the result that for two years abortion prevailed
among the cows served by this bull.</p>

<p class='c008'>J. R. Jansen reports that a cow brought from an infected farm,
for fattening purposes, proved to be pregnant and finally aborted,
and that 24 of the pregnant cows on the same farm aborted in
the same year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mörck relates how a cow that had aborted a fortnight previously
was taken to a farm where abortions had never been known.
She aborted during her next gestation and so did the rest of the
herd, 9 in number.</p>

<p class='c008'>Christensen records the occurrence of a general abortion in a
previously healthy herd, members of which had been sent for
service to the bull of a neighboring aborting herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nygaard reports that a bull from a healthy herd, but which
had been allowed to serve some cows from a neighboring infected
herd, was sold to go on a previously healthy farm, where he was
put to 14 cows only. Of these 12 aborted, and the complement
of the herd, beyond the 14 cows, put to another bull, remained
well.</p>

<p class='c008'>In each of these cases the environment of the animals and the
conditions remained the same, the one appreciable cause of the
outbreak being the contact with an animal from an aborting herd.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Experimental Infection.</i> Braüer led the way by transferring
in 11 instances the vaginal mucus of aborting cows to the vagina
of healthy ones. The resulting abortions occurred from the 9th
to the 21st day after inoculation. Lehnert repeated this on two
cows, the abortions taking place on the twelfth and twentieth days
respectively. Trinchera transferred the purulent vaginal mucus
of an aborting cow to the vaginæ of healthy ones, determining in
the latter, in 9 to 13 days, abortion attended by suppurating
vaginal catarrh. He secured similar results by using the material
scraped from the surface of the chorion of an immature fœtus.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Scottish Commission (Woodhead, McFadyean and Aitkin)
placed a healthy pregnant cow in an aborting herd, and on two
successive days lodged in her vagina for twenty minutes a piece
of cotton wool soaked in the vaginal mucus of a recently aborted
cow. Within a month abortion threatened, and on the seventieth
day a seven months calf was dropped.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>In a second experiment a cow, six months in calf, was taken
from a healthy herd and placed in an aborting dairy herd and a
quantity of vaginal mucus from a cow that had recently aborted
was injected under the skin of the vagina. She calved prematurely
at the end of the eighth month of gestation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Williamsen, while treating a herd for abortion, took a piece of
the afterbirth of one of the aborting cows and rubbed it on the
vagina of a healthy cow of his own, which had a habit of carrying
her calf fourteen days over time. Five days after she had
premature parturition.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took a fragment of the fœtal membrane from the cow just
named and rubbed it on the vagina of a pregnant cow condemned
for tuberculosis. In seventeen days the cow aborted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though not started as an experiment, the writer may name the
general extension of abortion from one or two cows in a tuberculous
herd after they had been tested with tuberculin. Cases of
this kind are doubtless much more common than has been supposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kilborne and Smith developed suppurating vaginal catarrh in
cows and mares by inoculating them with the artificial cultures
of bacilli obtained from the vaginal secretions of aborting mares.</p>

<p class='c008'>Turner made cultures from the ovaries of aborting mares, and
others from the genital organs of foals suffering from omphalitis,
and produced abortions in pregnant mares by injecting with the
same.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathology.</i> <i>Bacteriology.</i> Franck attributed the disease to
<i>leptothrix vaginalis</i>, but subsequent observers failed to substantiate
this.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Scottish Abortion Commission isolated five different bacteria
from the abortion membranes and vaginal mucus, but failed
to identify any one of these as, by itself, capable of causing the
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nocard found in the fibrino-purulent matter between the
chorion and womb in aborting animals a micrococcus occurring
singly or in chains, and a short, delicate bacillus isolated or in
pairs. From the absence of evil effects between pregnancies he
opines that the germs grow in the membranes only, and do not
affect the womb nor the general system. He recognizes, however,
that they survive in the womb from one pregnancy to another
in the complete absence of these membranes.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Galtier, on the contrary, conveyed the disease variously by the
inoculation or feeding of the milk or abortion membranes to
sheep, goat, pig, rabbit and Guinea pig, and accordingly claims
that the general system of the pregnant animal is infected, and
that the germs can be conveyed through the blood to the womb.
In deducing this from feeding experiments he appears to make
too little account of the ready infection through proximity of the
anus and vulva.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chester, of Delaware Agri. Experiment Station, found in the
fœtal membranes of aborting cows a bacillus, which in form and
habits of growth closely resembled the bacillus coli commune.
In the fermentation test, however, it showed a marked difference.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inoculated on rabbits it did not prove fatal. Injected into the
vagina of a healthy pregnant cow it caused slight catarrhal discharge
for four or five days, but the calf was carried to full time
six and a half months later.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bang found in aborting cows, between the womb and fœtal
membranes, a considerable odorless, gelatinoid, liquid exudate,
and some pus cells. There was active catarrh of the uterine
mucosa which often carried the disease over into the next pregnancy.
In the exudate he found a number of very minute nonmotile
bacilli (1 to 3μ), which stained readily with aniline colors,
excepting in a vacuole or nucleus which was less deeply pigmented.
This bacillus grew well in serum glycerine bouillon,
and more sparingly in serum-gelatine agar. In the latter it
showed a remarkable peculiarity which serves to identify it readily
from other microbes, in two successive zones of luxuriant
growth at two different depths, with an intermediate clear zone,
in which little or no growth took place. It seems to prefer a
greater or lesser supply of oxygen (21 or 90:100) without being
able to adapt itself to the intermediate condition. As already
stated it produced abortion in the cow in 21 days after injection
into the vagina. It also induced uterine catarrh and abortion in
ewes, goats, rabbits, Guinea pigs and mares when injected into
the vagina. From the vagina it usually reaches the womb, but
not always. In several cases in which it was injected subcutem
or intravenously it caused hyperthermia, and was later found in
abundance in the interior of the womb and fœtal membranes, and
in the bowels of the fœtus. The microbe is, therefore, capable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>living in the blood and affecting the womb by whatever channel
it may enter the system.</p>

<p class='c008'>V. A. Moore and the present writer made a series of experiments
at the New York State Veterinary College. In the fœtal
membranes and uterine mucus of a number of cows, aborting in
different parts of the State and therefore long distances apart, we
found a bacillus that in form and culture-experiments closely resembles
bacillus coli commune. This was nearly always in pure
cultures, and in the few cases showing other microbes, these were
only such as inhabit the healthy vagina. Our bacillus was never
found in the womb nor fœtal membranes of cows that had calved
at the full period in healthy herds. It agreed in most respects
with the bacillus found by Chester, but differed somewhat in fermentation
tests. It differed also in proving fatal to rabbits when
inoculated on these animals. Injected in the form of cultures
into the vagina in three old pregnant cows it continued to live on
the mucosa, producing more or less catarrh and muco-purulent
discharge in the different cases, yet all three carried the calf to
full time, one having calved on the 123d day after injection, the
second on the 167th, and the third on the 190th.</p>

<p class='c008'>The results obtained at the Delaware College Experiment Station
and the New York State Veterinary College, do not differ so
seriously, as either one does from those obtained in Europe, by
Nocard, Bang, and the Scottish Abortion Committee. The facts
that the same germs were found, either in pure cultures, or exceptionally,
along with the normal microbes of the healthy
vagina, in the womb, and fœtal membranes of every aborting cow,
that they were never found in the healthy cow which had calved at
full time, and that the generative passages were the seat of a
catarrh, alike in the cows that aborted and in those that were
inoculated with the abortion discharges, but did not themselves
abort, are all but conclusive that this microbe is the essential cause
of the abortion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The single objection to this view, namely that the inoculated
cows did not abort is explained by the fact that in the New York
abortions it is the rule that the calf is carried six or seven months
from the date of impregnation (the date of the presumptive infection)
to that of abortion. It is to be further borne in mind that
our experimental cows were old, and may have passed through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the disease before and become in some measure immune, that
they were dry during the experiment, and were subjected to no
extraneous excitement that would predispose them to abort. The
presumption is that had the experiments been started earlier in
the gestation, the abortion would have come in due time. The
microbe maintained its hold on the mucosa and continued to
advance up to and beyond parturition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another distinction of the European abortions, is in the presence
of the microbe in European form in the digestive organs of
the calf, and that the viable calves of infected cows are liable to
die of intestinal disorders a few days after birth. Galtier, the
Marquis de Poncius and Pry insist strongly on this. On a farm
on the estate of the Marquis, where abortion had prevailed for
twenty years, the calves of infected cows show at birth, or very
shortly after, symptoms of broncho-pneumonia and of a complication
of nervous disorders. They are breathless, wheeze, discharge
from the nose, cough, scour, have convulsions or other
nervous trouble. A large proportion of such calves die; and
their lungs are found in part red, consolidated and devoid of air
and the bronchia contain a muco-purulent product. Lesions
denoting inflammation of the serosæ of the lungs, liver and intestines
are common. This coincidence of a fatal disease in many of
the surviving calves is exceptional among the aborting herds of
New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>In noting the evidence of a wide difference between the prevalent
American and European forms of abortion in cows, one
should be prepared to go farther, and accept if need be, still other
distinctive forms in each of the two continents. Any catarrhal
condition of the uterine mucous membrane, is a recognized hindrance
to conception, and cause of abortion, and we must recognize
that the forms of invasion of the womb by pus microbes are as
numerous as there are irritant germs capable of living in the membrane.
The question as to how many of these can produce contagious
abortion is to be determined by the susceptibility of the
membrane to irritation by each germ, and whether the latter can
retain all its power of survival and virulence in passing from one
animal to another. The presumption is, therefore, in favor of a
variety of forms of contagious abortion, each due to its own specific
microbe or microbes, rather than of a single unvarying type
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>of the disease. In some the affection appears to be a purely local
one (American), the microbe being confined to the genital or
genito-urinary mucosa, whereas in others the microbes (Bangs’,
Galtier’s, etc.) live also in the blood producing a general infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two great types at least have been demonstrated in Europe
and America. Whether future investigation shall show the
presence in one of these continents of the types as yet only known
in the other, remains to be seen. If the particular forms should
turn out to be limited to different continents we are at once confronted
with the necessity of an international sanitary quarantine,
and inspection. Matters are bad enough now in our dairying
districts, but if we are to be open to the importation of new types
of abortion, which do not mutually immunize against each other,
but which may be taken one after another in succession through
a series of years, they may easily become incomparably worse.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Acquired Immunity.</i> The question of persistent abortion year
after year, in the same animal, is most important. If a first contagious
abortion entails a second, a third, a fourth and a fifth
in the same animal, in as many successive years, then manifestly
the preservation of such animal is a most wasteful economy, altogether
independently of the danger of her transmitting the infection
to healthy stock. If, however, she herself becomes immune
after a first or second abortion, it may be profitable to retain
her for milk production or breeding, provided that she can no
longer infect susceptible cows with which she must come in contact.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Acquired immunity</i> of the individual cow is the rule after one
or two abortions caused by the microbes with which we are at
present most familiar. There are exceptions to this rule due to
special nervousness and excitability of given cows, which tend
to an indefinite repetition of the abortion, under the stimulation
of pregnancy, of the continued presence of the microbe, or of
some local disease (tubercle, tumor, parasite, etc.) of the ovary,
womb or peritoneum. Yet statistics show that this only applies
to a small proportion of cows and these the most nervous and
excitable. The tendency toward insusceptibility to the deleterious
action of the germ, which may still be present, is in the cow as
a rule greater than the disposition toward a nervous encrease of
the susceptibility. The difficulty of reaching a conclusion on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>this point depends on the fact that stockowners very commonly
dispose of aborting cows, and as the freshly bought cows are
usually attacked sooner or later, it is too confidently assumed that
the old cows also would have continued to abort had they been
retained. Many years ago, however, observant New York dairymen
had noticed that the same cow rarely aborted over three
years in succession, and in the great majority of cases not over
two. The owner of a large herd, who has had much experience
with the disease, assures me that the rule has been, that a cow did
not abort with him a second time. The continuous abortion in a
herd was mainly among newly purchased cows and others that
had not been previously attacked, including heifers carrying
first calf. The same is in a measure true of the European abortions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nocard says that after three to five years there is an acquired
immunity. Only heifers and the cows that have been recently
bought in, abort.</p>

<p class='c008'>Penberthy, speaking of England, says that in case of repeated
abortion in the same cow, the calf is carried longer each successive
year until it comes to its full term.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sand, in his symposium of the experience of Danish veterinarians,
says it is quite exceptional that a cow should continue
to abort, but outbreaks of abortion disappear spontaneously if no
new cows are brought in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bang refers to a herd of 200 head of which 83 aborted in their
first pregnancy, and of these only 20 aborted in the second,
while 7 failed to breed. Counting the latter as having aborted,
this amounts to less than one-third, while over two-thirds of the
cows that aborted in the first gestation carried the calf to full time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Paulsen quotes the case of a herd of 16, 7 of which aborted
after service by a bull in an aborting herd. One of the seven
was sold, but the remaining six all went full time in the following
year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mörck records the case of a herd of 16 cows, the majority of
which aborted in the same year. All the aborting cows were
sold and fresh ones purchased. Next year the new stock aborted
together with some of the cows that had been held over. He
continued this course for eight years without any improvement,
and then decided to keep the aborting cows as well as the others.
In two years the affection disappeared from the herd.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Such small herds, in which all become early infected, and in
which there is no further opportunity for the infection of susceptible
animals (cows not yet infected, heifers in first gestation,
new purchases), furnish a better opportunity than do large herds,
to trace the acquirement of tolerance.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a question of this kind, one must allow for variations in the
different types of abortion caused by various microbes, but in the
forms with which we are familiar in Europe and America, the
acquired tolerance of the individual can be counted on with great
confidence. It has indeed been largely traded upon by purveyors
of antiabortion nostrums who promise to cure the individual cow,
to which alone their drugs are administered. Two evils result:
the stock owner’s money is paid for that which unaided, nature
would have accomplished for him; and attention is withdrawn
from the real necessity of the case, the prevention of the infection
of freshly introduced animals. The nostrum vender thus secures
for himself a growing market, as the yearly production of fresh
cases in the same herds, appears to demand a constant use of the
agent which appeared to work so well in the earlier ones.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunized animal still infecting.</i> The cow that no longer
aborts is not, therefore, a safe member of a herd. As an individual
animal she has become resistant to the pathogenic influence
of the germ, she is invulnerable to it to the extent that she
no longer aborts, but her system and generative passages have acquired
no such active bactericidal power over the microbe as to
lead to its speedy destruction. The genital passages, once colonized,
continue to be a field of growth of the bacillus long after
its power to cause abortion in that particular animal has passed.
Analogous cases can easily be quoted from the field of pathology.
The horse that has apparently recovered from dourine still conveys
the disease to others with which it has sexual congress; the
recovered syphilitic person is by no means eligible for marriage;
the recovered pig continues to carry the infecting swine plague
bacillus in its air passages. In short, it is the rule that the immunized
animal can with safety to itself carry a germ that readily
infects its nonimmunized fellows.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the case of infectious abortion this is one of the most dangerous
elements, as the apparently healthy recovered cow receives
no attention in the way of separation and disinfection, but is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>allowed to spread the infection through the bull that serves her
in common with other cows and by being sold into new and
healthy herds.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> Contagious abortion sometimes takes the form of
temporary sterility, the animal taking the male at frequent intervals,
but failing to conceive. If conception takes place, the
abortion is usually deferred until the fœtus has attained a considerable
development—in cows till the third or seventh month; in
mares till the fourth or ninth month; in ewes or sows till the
tenth week.</p>

<p class='c008'>Often times premonitory symptoms are entirely unobserved.
Usually there may be detected some heat and enlargement of the
mammæ, with a decrease in the milk yield, or a serous modification
of the milk as in colostrum. Still more striking is a muco-purulent
discharge from the vulva—opaque, white or yellow—in
marked contrast with the perfectly clear, transparent mucus
which appears in œstrum. The discharge may be densely white
(in mares) or reddish, and may be accompanied by some swelling
of the vulva and redness of its mucosa, which is dull, rough
and granular, or even the seat of a papillary eruption. There is
rarely hyperthermia or other constitutional disturbance, and in
some cases the abortion is only discovered by the finding of the
fœtus and its membranes in the gutter or pasture. The membranes
are, however, not unfrequently retained, becoming offensively
putrid. In other cases a muco-purulent discharge persists
for a length of time, insuring sterility so long as it lasts, and causing
ill health and emaciation. The fœtus is usually born dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>lesions</i> are confined to the generative organs. Bang,
found an odorless, dirty yellow, flocculent, slimy and more or
less watery exudate between the chorion and uterine mucosa involving
the connective tissue between the chorion and arachnoid
so as to render it thick and friable. These conditions were well
marked in the French and English cases, and perhaps somewhat
less so in the American, which are habitually slower in reaching
the abortion. Bang found the uterine catarrh with the characteristic
bacillus in cases in which the calf had been carried to full
term, exemplifying the local presence and culture of the bacillus
without the usual abortion outcome. The bacilli were occasionally,
though not always, found in the body of the fœtus, and in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>cases the dead and mummified fœtus was found in the womb,
which had not been stimulated to its expulsion. He even found
the bacillus in the mummified fœtus, and still virulent, after an
apparent seclusion of seven months.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ABORTION IN MARES.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This follows the same general course as does the disease in
cows. In certain American outbreaks (Kilborne and Th. Smith)
it has been traced to a bacillus like the colon bacillus, propagated
in the womb and genital passages, and which produced suppurating
vaginal catarrh in cows and mares on which it was inoculated.
It is liable to occur, without premonitory symptoms
having been observed, and to be followed by no marked sequelæ,
so that, as in most cases in the cow, it may be looked on as a
purely local infection. In England, Penberthy, found it to occur
not earlier than the fourth month of gestation, yet he adduces
several cases in which the first case in a breeding stud occurred
in four weeks after the introduction of an infected mare
from an aborting stud. In America on large breeding farms the
introduction of the infection has proved ruinous, as many as 70
or 80 per cent. of the mares having aborted in the same season.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conclusion is inevitable, that as in the case of cattle, the
sire may become the means of transmission, and that the same
measures of prevention are demanded. The fact that the affection
is less widely spread or injurious, than in cattle, is largely
due to the usual presence of but one, two or three breeding mares
on a farm, so that there is little opportunity for a rapid extension
of the infection. Multiply and encrease our studs of breeding
horses, as cows have been in our dairying districts, and abortion,
once introduced, would prove equally infective, spreading and
injurious.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Therapeutics</i> are useless in contagious abortion as the disease
usually runs its course before any danger is suspected. If premonitory
symptoms are observed, the abortion may sometimes be
warded off for a time by secluding the animal in a quiet place and
seeking to obviate labor pains by opiates and ounce doses of
viburnum prunifolium.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> This is to be sought along two principal lines:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>1st. The protection of a sound herd against the infection: and
2nd. The extinction of infection in a herd already diseased.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Protection of a sound herd.</i> This requires the greatest possible
care, because the infected animal usually presents the general
appearance of perfect health, and there is no ready means of
testing the presence or absence of the abortion bacillus. In purchasing
a cow or mare in a public market the new owner may
find her affected with this bacillus, and a serious danger to his
whole herd. To protect the latter he must learn that the herd
from which she came has had no abortions for several years
before, and that the offspring for the different years are present
in numbers corresponding to the dams. In the absence of this a
certificate, and guarantee against infection of other animals by the
one purchased, may well be demanded of the seller. A certificate
from the veterinarian attending the herd furnishing the animal,
may also be sought as evidence of the absence of abortion from
the locality. Imported animals should be safeguarded in the
same way but with even greater care, lest the microbian sources
of new types of abortion, should be brought into the country. A
guarantee of this kind might well be demanded by the Federal
Government in the case of all breeding animals imported.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of failure to secure the most perfect guarantee with the
purchased animal it would be worth the purchaser’s while to
seclude it from his valuable herd, and not to breed it with the
other animals of his herd until it has been proved to be entirely
free from infection. If bought for a sire it should be subjected
to a course of disinfection of the sheath and penis: if for a dam
and unimpregnated, antiseptic irrigation of the vagina may be
made daily for a week, and the external parts, hips and tail daily
washed with antiseptics. If very important to have her bred,
secure, if possible, a male that is not to be used on other animals.
If this is impracticable, let the sheath and penis, and surrounding
skin be thoroughly disinfected as soon as the service has been had.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the newly acquired female is pregnant, keep her by herself
until parturition and, even if this takes place at full term, irrigate
the womb daily for a week with a disinfectant, delay having her
served for a month, and if she must go to the sire of the herd,
subject him to thorough disinfection after service. It may be
that she still carries the germ but has become tolerant of it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span><i>Extinction of Contagious Abortion in a Herd.</i> 1. Two separate
stables, or compartments, not having a common gutter should be
provided, one for the sound animals, and one for those that are
known to be affected, or that are open to suspicion.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The cow or mare that shows symptoms of abortion, or that
has aborted, should at once be removed to the quarantine stable,
and her stall, including the gutter and drain leading from it
thoroughly disinfected. The whole stable should be whitewashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The aborted fœtus with its membranes, should be at once
removed and burned, or boiled, or deeply buried after it has been
thickly sprinkled with chloride of lime or other active disinfectant.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The manure from the infected stable should be taken into an
enclosure into which no animals have access, and freely watered
with a solution of sulphate of copper (6:100).</p>

<p class='c008'>5. All in the quarantined stable and even those left in the general
stable, should have the external generative organs, the hips,
and the whole length of the tail washed once or twice a day with
an antiseptic solution. Carbolic acid or creolin (2 or 3:100)
makes a very safe and convenient agent, but copper sulphate
(6:100) or mercuric chloride (2:1000) may be substituted.
The colorless mercuric solution though effective and inodorous,
has an element of danger in it, when left in barns in large
quantities.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Cows or mares that have just aborted, should have the
uterus irrigated daily for a week with a disinfectant solution.
Carbolic acid (1:100 with 1 sodium carbonate) or creolin (1 to
2:100) or mercuric chloride (1:1000 with 1 hydrochloric acid)
are good examples. Use a long rubber tube and funnel. They
should not be bred until all discharge has ceased.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. It is a good practice to keep a separate sire for the aborting
and quarantined suspected animals, but the bull for each herd
should, after each service, have his sheath injected with the disinfectant
liquid, the orifice being held and the liquid pressed into
all parts and finally, the skin around the sheath must be well
washed with the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. All cows or mares in an aborting herd, or one from which
aborting animals have been removed within a year, should, after
delivery, be injected with a disinfectant for one week exactly as
if they had just aborted. This will guard against the danger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>from animals that carry the germ, but have become so tolerant of
it that they no longer themselves abort.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. New born animals brought in from other herds should be
sponged all over with one of the above-named disinfectant solutions
before being added to the herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. In case the breeding animals go to pasture, separate fields
should be furnished for the aborting and suspected ones and those
supposed to be sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. Breeding ewes, goats and sows should be excluded from
all pastures occupied by suspected herds or those under treatment.
The fields should further be cleared of rabbits as being susceptible
to the infection and capable of keeping it up and transmitting it.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. It is important to reserve the herd sires for the exclusive
use of the home herds. Where this cannot be done, disinfection
of the sheath and penis should be practised immediately after
each service.</p>

<p class='c008'>Attempts have been made at different times to destroy the
bacillus by subcutaneous or intermuscular disinfectant injections.
Bäuer used in the cow a 2 per cent. solution of carbolic acid, of
which he injected two Pravaz syringefuls under the skin of the
flank every fortnight from the fifth to the seventh month. It
was rather unreasonable to expect much from 10 minims of carbolic
acid once a fortnight, even apart from the fact that this
agent is converted into the inert sulphophenic acid in the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres followed in the same line by injecting into the bodies
of the cervical or other muscles 10cc. (2½ drams) of a mixture
of terpinol one part, olive oil nine parts. This was injected during
pregnancy every second day for the first three months, every
third day for the second three months, and every fourth day for
two months. The claim for success is based on the alleged prevention
of second and third abortions in the same animals, and
this becomes rather shadowy when we consider that the rule with
cows is that they do not abort a second or third time. We have
met with veterinarians who claimed a splendid success with the
single injection of the terpinol. Lignieres claims no such success
with his long continued treatment, as he had a percentage of
abortions in every herd treated, and from first to last almost
every animal in each herd aborted once, or was sold nymphomaniac.
It is to be feared that the apparent immunity depended
mainly on that tolerance which comes early in nearly every case
to the aborting cow.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INFECTIOUS ENTERO-HEPATITIS IN TURKEYS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Blackhead. Definition: Infectious protozoan disease of cæca and liver
and general toxicæmia. Microbiology: Amœba in cæca, liver, etc.
Symptoms: Attacks young, dulness, drooping, ruffling, moping, anorexia,
greenish diarrhœa, icteric or dusky mucosæ, blackening of gobble, etc.
Lesions: Enlarged thickened cæca, epithelial degeneration and desquamation,
exudation, mottled liver, with giant and round cells and amœbæ, degeneration,
necrosis, caseation, no abscess. Diagnosis from bacteridian
typhlitis or diphtheria. Treatment: Intestinal antisepsis. Prevention:
Disinfection of buildings, yards, manure, seclude from other flocks, birds,
flies, breed new flock on fresh ground from eggs of affected or other flock,
set in incubator or under hens.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonym</i>: Blackhead.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An infectious disease of turkeys, especially destructive
to the young, due to a protozoön (amœba meleagridis),
and characterized by inflammatory thickening of the walls of the
cæca, diarrhœa, brownish, yellowish or greenish areas of degeneration
of the liver, and congestion with blackish discoloration of
those portions of the head which are uncovered by down or
feathers.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> The microörganism (amœba meleagridis) is
found in the thickened walls of the cæca, in the exudate, in the
lumen, and in the degenerating patches of the liver. The most
common and simple form is that of a rounded body, varying
slightly in form, and containing a group of very minute granules
situated somewhat eccentrically. They may be enclosed in lymph
spaces or less frequently in giant cells, or have portions of broken
up cells adherent. Their size varies from 10 to 15μ. They may
be stained by the following process: Harden in 95 per cent.
alcohol saturated with mercuric chloride, then in the same with
an equal amount of a 5 per cent. solution of bichromate of potash,
and finally in Hemming’s solution. After a day in these solutions
they are washed for a day in running water, then treated
with ascending strengths of alcohol, dried by passing through
alcohol and chloroform, imbedded in paraffin, sectioned dry, and
stained in Delafield’s hæmatoxylin and eosin. The spherical or
slightly oval amœbæ have a homogeneous, bluish red tint, feebler
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>and therefore distinct from the tissue nuclei. Near the centre in
most a blue circular line shows the outlines of the nucleus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Th. Smith compares this affection with the amœbic dysentery
affecting the large intestine and liver of man, and notes these
differences, that amœbic movements have not been observed in
amœba meleagridis, and that hepatic abscess does not occur in the
turkey. The indisposition of the bird to suppuration may perhaps
account for the latter distinction. Smith found rounded
organisms in the tubules of the cæca and flagellates in the lumen
of the gut, but did not attach any importance to their presence.
Bacteria were only found in the lesions in the solid tissues where
the subject had not been killed and immediately examined, but
left over night for examination in the morning. There was no
constancy in their species as in the case of the amœbæ, all indicating
that their invasion was post mortem.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The disease is most frequent and fatal in the
young (1 to 4 months, exceptionally 6 to 10 months), and the
symptoms vary much in different cases, according to the intensity
of the disease and the relatively extensive implication of the different
organs. Among the general symptoms are those of general
suffering and ill health, dulness, spiritlessness, drooping of the
head between the wings, a pendent condition of wings and tail,
erection of down or feathers, separation from the flock, the bird
moping alone and sitting much of the time. The more characteristic
phenomena which are rarely sufficient to identify the
disease unless it is known to be prevalent, are loss of appetite, a
greenish diarrhœa, yellowish or brownish discoloration of
mucosæ, emaciation which becomes extreme if the subject survives
long enough, and more or less blackish discoloration of the
gobble and bare portions of the skin covering the head.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> These are characteristic, the cæca being greatly
enlarged, the walls thickened by a yellowish submucous exudate,
the epithelium disintegrated and desquamating, and the mucosa
covered by a solid yellowish gelatinoid exudate arranged in superposed
layers, while the contents are soft, pasty or of a greenish
liquid appearance. The comparative stagnation of the contents
as in the appendix of man appears to favor microbian infection.
Amœbæ are especially abundant in the exudate into the submucosa
and in the lymph spaces. The liver changes show infective inflammation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>in the spots of mottling, followed by degeneration, and
necrosis, the liver cells disappearing under the compression of the
giant and round cells and the amœbæ, the surface over the affected
parts is depressed, and the mottling may show a variety of
colors, as brown, brownish red, or yellow, pale yellow, grayish or
dirty white. The degenerating tissue may become caseated, but
abscess appears to be unknown, though so common in amœbic
dysentery of man. In the skin of the head the blackish color
predominates; there is more or less congestion, capillary embolism,
and tissue degeneration.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> Th. Smith notes three cases of diseased cæcæ without
great thickening of their walls, and an exudate in the lumen having
the general appearance of that seen in the amœba disease but
with no amœbæ, only the bacillus coli communis. The odor was
strongly feculent. In all three cases the liver was healthy. In
one there was an abundance of tapeworms in the bowels. Manifestly
the absence of liver lesions may be held to indicate the
absence of the protozoan disease. VonRatz (Budapest) gives two
similar cases, with many nematodes, those in the exudate being
8 to 14 mm. long.</p>

<p class='c008'>Zurn describes the presence of the diphtheria of fowls in the
intestines of hens, turkeys and palmipeds and sometimes confined
to the cæca. It is characterized by great prostration and debility,
and an offensively smelling diarrhœa at first pultaceous and
mucous, later bloody, and followed by constipation, in which case
the cæca and rectum are ulcerated and blocked with the yellow
croupous exudate. It lasts 2 to 3 weeks or even months, is subject
to relapse, and sometimes occurs as a sequel to the diphtheritic
affection of the head and throat. The absence of marked thickening
of the cæcal wall, and of the protozoön, the presence of the
diphtheritic exudate in the lumen, and the croupous condition or
congested appearance of the head and throat are distinctive. Th.
Smith, however, refers to two cases, supposed to be of this kind,
in which the walls of the cæca were greatly thickened, the result
of reparatory inflammation following a slough of the mucosa.
Siedamgrotzky also describes thickening of the walls of both cæca
in a hen, the mucosa being covered with a thin pseudo-membranous
exudation, without ulceration.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would seem that the cæca of birds, like the vermiform appendix
of man is very subject to invasion microbes, bacterian and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>protozoan, and should always be carefully examined in case of
intestinal or hepatic disorder.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> would be in the line of intestinal antisepsis with
carbolic acid, salol, sulphurous acid, or the sulphites, with a laxative
of castor oil, to carry these agents unchanged to the cæca,
but no success has attended attempts in this direction, and the
danger that comes from preservation of the infected animal, and
consequent multiplication of the microbe would as a rule far more
than counterbalance any probable recoveries.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> Moore has shown that the amœbæ, passed with
the fæces, contaminate the food and water and thus actively
propagate the disease, so that preventive measures must be mainly
directed toward the purification of these infecting media. To be
thorough new ground must be secured on which no diseased
turkeys have been, and through which no water from contaminated
or suspected land can flow; if necessary this must be
closely fenced to prevent all ingress or egress, and on this ground
we can place, as soon as they leave the shell, young turkeys
hatched from eggs obtained in noninfected localities, or the eggs
carefully washed of the turkeys living on infected ground. In
this way the heredity and quality of the flock can be preserved
without risk of contamination from the parents. The amœba is
not known as a parasite of other birds, but if it should eventually
be found to be so or to occupy any other animal body as an intermediate
host, the local extermination of such host will become a
necessary precaution.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a new flock has been started in this way, the birds of
the old flock may be fattened, killed and marketed, and as suggested
by Cooper Curtice the grounds they have occupied may be
secluded by fencing for one or two years, in the hope that the
amœba will perish by this break in the chain of its life history.
If this should prove successful with the land, the infection might
be easily exterminated in the whole infected district or state.</p>

<p class='c008'>The poultry buildings will require thorough disinfection. All
manure and droppings must be carefully removed and the building
whitewashed, using freshly burned quicklime and ¼ lb. of
chloride of lime to the gallon of the mixture. The litter should
be burned, and all nests, roosts, drinking vessels and troughs
soaked with a mixture of sulphuric acid ½ gallon, carbolic acid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>½ gallon, and water 20 gallons, (Th. Smith). The agents are
mixed slowly in a vessel set in cold water. The same may be
liberally applied on the surface, fences, etc., of the yards. Or
quicklime, freshly burned, may be used freely on the yards holding
the infected flocks (Moore). Mercuric chloride is dangerous.
When the infected flock has been finally disposed of, the buildings
and yards should be again thoroughly disinfected, and
together with the field runs, abandoned for at least one year.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ASTHENIA IN CHICKENS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Microbiology: bacillus of colon group. Pathogenesis to Guinea pigs:
rabbits, pigeons and chickens refractory to artificial cultures. Treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonym.</i> “Going Light,” Bacterial Infection of the Duodenum.</p>

<p class='c008'>C. F. Dawson, in investigating a wasting disease of well fed
Brahma fowls in Maryland in which there was no appreciable
symptom except the gradual and extreme loss of flesh and weight
found in all cases a catarrhal duodenitis, with the presence in the
contents of a bacterium in pure cultures, and apparently allied to
bacillus coli communis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> The bacterium is 1 to 1.3μ long, by .5μ wide,
with rounded ends, often in pairs. It does not stain in acid nor
alkaline methylene blue, carbol fuchsin, nor alcoholic dyes, but
stains easily in aqueous solutions of the same stains and by
Gram’s method. It is ærobic, facultative anærobic, grows at
50° to 120° F. in acid or alkaline beef bouillon, with fœtor; in
glucose, saccharose, or lactose bouillon with the production of
acid; in milk causing coagulation; on gelatine, agar and potato.
Growth in Bouillon ceased at 131° F. and sterilization took place
at 135° to 140° F. Vitality was not lost under freezing nor
drying. It was killed by a 1 per cent. solution of carbolic acid in
five minutes, or by formaldehyde gas, but not by lime water.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathogenesis.</i> Inoculated subcutem, in a <i>Guinea pig</i> caused
death in 24 hours, with a necrotic œdematous condition of the
adjacent tissues like malignant œdema, and containing the
microbe. It was further found in the liver, spleen, abdominal
exudate, heart, blood and lungs, but not in the kidneys.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>It proved harmless to <i>rabbits</i> when injected subcutem, but fatal
in 24 hours when thrown into the peritoneum. The lesions were
severe duodenitis and omental inflammation, and the bacterium
was found in the liver and duodenal wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pigeons, rats and mice proved refractory to the artificial cultures,
also chickens. The latter were injected subcutem, intraabdominally
and intravenously. Yet in view of the constancy of
the lesion in hens with the microbe in pure cultures and the
absence of all other morbid conditions, Dawson felt justified in
attributing the disease to this microörganism. It is possible that
his experimental hens had become immune from a previous
attack, or failed in some condition of food or environment which
is essential to pathogenesis, or finally there may possibly be some
other infinitesimal microbe present which escaped observation,
but which furnished the occasion for the coincident development
of the colon bacterium.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> The indications are: the expulsion of the offending
bacterium to be followed by nutritious, easily digested food,
pure water and tonics. Dawson advises castor oil in dose of two
teaspoonfuls, or calomel ¼ grain repeated till purgation occurs;
and to be followed by powdered fennel, anise, coriander, cinchona
of each 30 grains; powdered gentian and ginger of each ½
dram; powdered copperas 15 grains. The addition of bismuth,
pepsin, or orexin may be suggested.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>APOPLECTIFORM SEPTICÆMIA IN CHICKENS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Streptococcic infection in hens. Most violent in pullets and hens; less so
in capons and cockerels. Found dead, or sick 24 hours, ruffled, prostrate,
neck limp, head drooped, indisposed or unable to rise, liquid icteric fæces,
blood-stained skin of neck and breast, death without agony. Lesions:
Soiled anal feathers, plump carcass, skin pallor save neck and breast, extravasation
of blood subcutem and intramuscular, mucosæ anæmic, peritoneal
engorgement and effusion, enlarged, engorged liver, cell proliferation,
degeneration, coagulation necrosis, gall bladder full. Enlarged congested
spleen, degeneration. Congested swollen kidneys, epithelial degeneration,

lungs, with microbe. Meningeal congestion, exudate. Bacteriology:
Streptococcus, pure cultures in lesions, size, chains, tetrads, staining qualities,
culture media, colonies, action on sugars, acid, no gas, on milk no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>coagulation, on gelatine no liquefaction. History: Stagnant water; no evident
source of infection, buzzards, etc. Pathogenesis: Inoculation, intravenous
or intramuscular, feeding. On duck, pigeon, rabbits, mice, dogs.
Guinea pigs and sheep immune. Immunization by injection of sterilized
cultures.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under this name Norgaard describes a hæmorrhagic streptococcic
infection which prevailed in 1901 in a flock of 200 to 250
Plymouth Rocks in Loudon County, Va. Forty birds died within
six weeks, and later the mortality reached 200, death often
occurring suddenly while feeding, or the birds would drop from
their roosts in the night and be found dead in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> In the majority, the pullets which died suddenly,
no symptoms whatever were observed, yet a certain number of
the capons and cockerels were noticeably ill for 12 to 24 hours.
In these the feathers were ruffled, the prostration extreme, the
head drooped between the wings, the neck was weak and wobbling
(limber neck), the wings and tail drooped, and the animal
lay on its breast often unable to rise. Sometimes there was a
passage per anum of liquid bile-stained mucus. Close examination
of the neck and breast might detect hæmorrhagic discoloration
of the skin, though the skin elsewhere was pale and smooth.
Death takes place without a struggle.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The anal feathers were usually stained, indicating
diarrhœa; the picked carcass was plump and fat, with pale,
healthy looking skin, except on the neck and breast, where it
was discolored by extravasated blood; at such points the connective
tissue and muscles were infiltrated with blood in areas of an
inch in diameter, more or less, and with irregular outlines. The
buccal mucosa was clear, pale and bloodless. The cavity of the
body contained an abundance of sero-sanguinolent exudate, and
the mesenteric veins were engorged. The <i>liver</i> was greatly enlarged
and congested, the greater part of its substance being apparently
composed of the distended blood vessels. The hepatic
cells were granular and fatty, and if death had been delayed over
twenty-four hours their outline became indistinct and the nucleus
stained only faintly. In the foci of disease were clumps of round
cells and leucocytes in and between the acini, and in still more
tardy cases points of coagulation necrosis. The streptococcus
was abundant in the necrotic centres, among the clumps of leucocytes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>in the parenchyma and capillaries. The <i>gall bladder</i> was
usually distended with bile. The <i>spleen</i> had the large size and
well developed Malpighian bodies that characterize the well-fed
bird, but it showed still greater enlargement, combined with sanguineous
congestion and circumscribed blood extravasations.
With a hand lens were seen numerous round, semi-transparent
points, the size of pin holes, which the microscope revealed to be
centres of coagulation necrosis, surrounded by embryonic tissue.
The centres consisted of a granular debris with abundance of the
streptococcus. The <i>kidneys</i> were congested and swollen, and in
cases that had survived two or three days there was granular degeneration
of the epithelium of the tubules, and the lumen of the
tubes contained casts with leucocytes and streptococci. The organism
was also present in the capillaries. The <i>lungs</i> presented
areas of congestion and consolidation, exudation into the walls of
the bronchioles and the alveoli, and an abundance of streptococci
in the lesions. In the cranium were a subdural exudate and
meningeal congestion. For examination of the tissues they were
hardened in specimens of alcohol of encreasing strengths, embedded
in paraffin and stained with carbol fuchsin with a counterstain
of methylene blue.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> The streptococcus was found in pure cultures in
all the diseased centres except in the intestinal contents. Smear
preparations were made from the blood, the abdominal exudate,
the intestinal contents, the bone marrow, the cerebral exudate
and the sanguineous effusions into the muscles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The coccus is .6 to .8μ in diameter, in short chains of 2 to 8
cells, or in some media much longer. Involution forms are common,
and Norgaard claims to have seen indications of fission in
two directions to form tetrads. The organism stains in the usual
aniline dyes, as well as by Gram’s and Gram-Weigert’s method.
It is nonmotile, ærobic, facultative anærobic, grows in solid and
liquid media that is neutral, or slightly acid or alkaline (not if
strongly acid), best at 98.6° F., and slower at the room temperature.
In alkaline peptonized beef bouillon in 24 hours it forms
threads and balls on the sides and bottom of the tube, leaving the
liquid clear. On agar there are formed small shining, grayish
colonies 1.5 mm. in diameter with brownish centre and bluish periphery.
With all the sugars it produces acid, but no gas. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>does not coagulate milk. On gelatine colonies are formed in four
days, and there is no liquefaction.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History of the Outbreak.</i> The outbreak commenced early in
January, without any obvious occasion for the introduction of
infection. There had been no chicken disease on the place for 25
years, and no chickens had been purchased except from a neighboring
farm where the stock remained healthy. They had been
fed on corn meal, wheat bran, wheat tailings and whole corn,
together with scorched wheat from a burned barn. The poultry
houses were clean and well aired, and after they had been closed
there was no abatement of the disease. The water was from a
stagnant pool receiving drainage from the stable, but this was no
new condition and January is not the driest month with the foulest
water. The suggestion may be hazarded that the infection
may have been introduced by the usual infection bearer, the buzzard,
or by some other wild bird, or mammal.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathogenesis.</i> Among the <i>chickens</i> the most rapid and fatal
cases were in pullets, then among the laying hens, while the
capons and cockerels were less severely affected, and some survived
from three to seven days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those <i>inoculated intravenously</i> as a rule sickened on the second
or third day with a temperature of 110.7° F., and were found
dead the following morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some took injections of .25 to 1cc. in the <i>pectoral muscles</i> with
impunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chickens that had fasted 24 hours, took each daily for 3 days,
a few cubes of bread soaked in a fresh bouillon culture. Death
followed in four out of six, in from four to thirteen days from the
beginning of the experiment. The birds gradually became listless,
refused to eat, and remained quiet in a corner of the cage,
with closed eyes and head drooping until it rested on the ground.
Diarrhœa was frequent but not invariably present.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chickens fed on the chopped up viscera of rabbits that had died
of the disease perished in 3 to 10 days.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>white duck</i> inoculated intravenously with .5cc. of peptonized
beef bouillon culture, took ill on the 8th day, and died on the
12th. There was loss of coördination and use of the wings, temperature
109° F., and necropsy showed valvular endocarditis containing
the streptococcus. A second duck sickened on the 11th
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>day, but recovered after three days’ illness. Killed on 21st day,
all cultures from heart, spleen and kidney remained sterile. Subcutaneous,
intramuscular and feeding experiments failed to produce
the disease in ducks.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>pigeon</i> injected with .5cc. bouillon culture intravenously died
on the fourth day with the internal lesions of chickens, and blood
extravasations on head and neck. Intra-muscular injections and
feeding experiments were fruitless.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>rabbits, intravenous</i> injections of 1 to 1.5cc. led in 24 hours,
to temperature of 105.3° F., without impairment of appetite, or
other marked sign of illness, and as a rule the subject is found
dead next morning. <i>Intra-abdominal</i> and <i>intrapleural</i> injections
kill in two to four days, and <i>subcutaneous</i> ones in three days. In
addition to the lesions found in chickens, there is often bloody
urine, a sanguineous lymph on and beneath the cerebral meninges
and in the fourth ventricle, and deep congestion of the cancellated
tissue of the vertebræ. Streptococci are abundant in the lesions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>mice intraabdominal</i> injection of .01cc. killed in 48 hours,
and <i>subcutaneous</i> injections in 2 to 5 days. The lesions were like
those seen in birds, and streptococci were abundant.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>dogs</i> after <i>intravenous</i> injection there was hyperthermia
(103.6° and 104.1° F.) and lameness of the right fore shoulder
joint, followed in 5 to 8 days by recovery. Feeding on the
viscera of the diseased chickens, was followed by anorexia, and
vomiting only.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Guinea pigs</i> and <i>sheep</i> proved refractory.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization.</i> The injection into the wing vein of .5 to 2.5cc.
of bouillon culture, sterilized by heat proved protective to the
chickens against inoculations of the virus while the check animals
invariably died.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Consumption; Tabes; Scrofula; Pining; Grapes;
Great White Plague, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An infectious disease common to man and a large
number of animals, caused by the bacillus tuberculosis, and
characterized by a productive inflammation giving rise to small,
rounded bodies (tubercles), or diffuse infiltration, with a tendency
to necrotic degeneration, and caseation, or to fibroid degeneration
(sclerosis), calcification or ulceration.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> Tuberculosis comes near to being a panzoötic,
since although reptiles, fishes, birds and some mammals
do not readily contract it under normal conditions, yet under abnormal
and debilitating conditions nearly all will succumb to it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Reptiles.</i> Sutton found tuberculosis in a python which was
kept so warm in the London Zoological Gardens that a thermometer
between its folds registered 85° F. Kráhl, Battaillon
and Ferre cultivated the bacillus in frogs, Kráhl in snakes.
Blauvelt found tuberculosis in a salamander. Lechner found it
in amphibia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fishes.</i> Broussais records the prevalence of tuberculosis in
carp in a pond which received the sputa of a consumptive man.
Under the skin were found rounded tumors, containing abundance
of bacilli, that infected rabbits and Guinea pigs on which
they were inoculated.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Birds.</i> In birds of the farmyard—hens, pheasants, turkeys,
ducks and pigeons—it is very frequent and often occurs as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>epizoötic. While the tuberculosis of barnyard fowl is a manifest
variety and not readily interchangeable with the varieties affecting
the mammal, yet, with a special predisposition, it can be
transferred and can then be conveyed from animal to animal in
the new genus in which it has been implanted. That of cage
birds is interchangeable with that of man.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Rodents.</i> Guinea pigs have a strong susceptibility to tuberculosis,
whether from human or bovine source, and rabbits for that
of birds, and by continuous transmission through the body of the
rodent, all alike seem to tend toward acquiring common characters.
The Guinea-pig, therefore, has been especially availed of
for the experimental transmission of tuberculosis, and, as the disease
in them becomes acute and rapid in its progress, these subjects
permit the multiplying of experiments in a short period.
<i>Rabbits</i> are less vulnerable to the bovine or human form.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sheep and goats</i>, kept under usual conditions, show a remarkable
immunity from tuberculosis, yet if directly inoculated
an inherent susceptibility is easily shown. Habitual immunity
may be in some degree due to their open air life, to the heavy
winter fleece protecting them against chills, to the comparative
absence of the heavy and continuous milk yield demanded of
cows, to the more restricted development of the lymph plexuses
in the lungs and elsewhere, and to the limited opportunity offered
by the small tonsils for infection entrance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>horse, ass and mule</i> rarely contract tuberculosis casually,
the more spacious stall, outdoor life, hard muscular condition, the
very small tonsils, the exclusive nasal respiration, the paucity of
connective tissue lymph plexuses, and the abundance of red
globules, probably favor immunity. Yet on inoculation by
Chauveau, Nocard and others, the horse readily succumbed to
infection, generalization taking place more certainly than in the ox.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cattle.</i> The bovine races are remarkably subject to tuberculosis.
This is probably due in part to the great amount of connective
tissue lymph plexus in the lungs and elsewhere, the habit
of using the mouth in hurried breathing, the deep, sudden inspiration
through the mouth and over the tonsils that follows a
cough, the habitual restricted size of the cow stables, the absence
of individual separated stalls, the habit of feeding from the same
trough with the cattle adjacent, the great drain of yearly breeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>and heavy milking, the retention in the herd of old, failing cows
for their milk product and high priced offspring, and the bovine
habit of licking each other with the infected tongue. In many
European cities and even in country districts the disease is very
prevalent. In Copenhagen a few years ago 17.7 per cent. of all
oxen and cows killed in the abattoirs were tuberculous; in Berlin
15 per cent.; in Holland 20 per cent.; in Pomerania and Bomberg
50 per cent.; in Hildesheim, Hanover, 50 per cent.; in Berlin
dairies 75 per cent. (Ostertag): in Leipsic and Edinburgh 20
per cent. The great variation in the data for the different cities
is suggestive of different inspection standards. American figures
as given by the Bureau of Animal Industry are for Baltimore
(mostly cows recently from the country) 2.5 to 3.5 per cent.;
and for the packing centers (among 2,273,547 mostly fat steers,
and therefore selected) 0.02 per cent. It is here largely a matter
of locality and infection, I have seen large herds with 100 per
cent. tuberculous, and extensive districts, in the north and especially
in the south entirely free from the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dogs and cats</i> in their natural condition rarely show the disease,
but contract it readily on inoculation. Cadiot found 40 cases in
9,000 <i>post mortems</i> of dogs. The young are apparently more
susceptible than the old, and primary lesions in the abdomen are
common and suggest infection through the food. The majority
belonged to consumptive persons, and gnawed the bones that had
been first picked by the owner, and ate from his plate what he
left. Jacobi records the case of a dog, with general tuberculosis,
which habitually licked up the expectorations of his phthisical
master.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Apes and Monkeys</i>, in confinement, almost all die of tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Swine</i> contract tuberculosis readily, the large tonsils, the habit
of breathing through the mouth, and the abundance of connective
tissue and lymph plexuses in the lungs and elsewhere contributing
to this. Yet in them the affection is mainly a dietetic disease.
Swine kept in the country and fed on vegetable food are rarely
affected. In Saxony, where 17 per cent. of the cattle are tuberculous
only a shade over one per cent. of swine were so, and in
Baden only 0.02 per cent. In hogs raised on our western farms
and corn-fed the proportion is much less. Yet in those fed on
uncooked skim milk, kitchen scraps and the refuse of slaughterhouses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>in a raw state, tuberculosis becomes very common.
In one case, in a large public institution, where the dairy herd
was universally affected, and where, on their slaughter, their raw
offal had been thrown to the hogs, I found that the latter were
almost all tuberculous. Similarly, in feeding experiments, from
the time of Gerlach, pigs and especially young pigs, have shown
themselves to be very susceptible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the less domesticated animals that contract tuberculosis
may be named <i>deer</i>, <i>elk</i>, <i>gazelle</i>, <i>antelope</i>, <i>camel</i>, <i>dromedary</i>,
<i>giraffe</i>, <i>kangaroo</i>, <i>lion</i>, <i>tiger</i>, <i>jackal</i>, <i>jaguar</i>, <i>bear</i>, <i>arctic fox</i>, <i>rat</i>,
<i>mouse</i> and the <i>common cage birds</i>, etc. Fröhner found 36 per
cent. of parrots affected in Berlin.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Man</i> has long been recognized as standing in the front rank of
susceptibility to tuberculosis. Yet even in his case the prevalence
of the affection bears an intimate relation to his indoor life.
In large cities <i>post mortems</i> often show that one-third have suffered,
and that one-seventh and upward of the whole population
die of tuberculosis. Natives of tropical islands and countries,
living in the open air and apart from close association with civilized
man, often escape entirely. In South Africa the herdsmen
living in close buildings suffer encreasingly, while their cattle,
kept constantly in the open pasture, escape.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> The prevalence of tuberculosis
shows a direct relation to the opportunity for infection rather
than to climate, latitude or altitude. It is the prevailing disease
of civilized communities with dense populations, and especially in
large cities where the general vitality is lowered and the crowded
buildings give every opportunity for infection. It is preëminently
the disease of Central Europe, of Great Britain and of our
Eastern States, where there is the greatest activity in business,
manufacture and commerce. Yet in the Scottish Hebrides, Iceland,
Newfoundland, the Greenland Highlands, Arctic North
America, the northern parts of Norway and Sweden, Lapland
and Finland it is hardly known. The absence of commerce and
cattle and the sparse population have much to do with this.
The coasts of Greenland with their Danish stations have two-thirds
of the population tuberculous (Cook); the Indians of Barrow’s
Straits, when infected in 1899 by the frozen-in whalers, suffered
from it as from a plague; in Christiana, Stockholm and St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>Petersburg it is as prevalent as in the large cities of Central
Europe. Elevated and dry climates have often been found to be
free from the affection, yet it prevails inside the double windows
of houses in the higher Alps, and has, within a generation established
a notorious prevalence in Minnesota, Dakota and westward,
as it has in Australia, mainly owing to the advent of consumptives
who sought for health in the dry atmosphere. The hills
and dry tablelands in North and South America, Africa and Asia
which have acquired a reputation for salubrity, owe this largely
to the sparse population and the absence of facilities for infection.
In South Africa, in spite of the dry and genial climate, the disease
is constantly encreasing in the human (housed) population. The
sea-coasts, which are the seats of large cities and the centres of
population and trade, are also the most extensively affected with
tuberculosis—in the West Indian Islands, Panama, Nicaragua,
Mexico, Yucatan, Columbia, Equador, Peru, Chili, Ceylon,
Guinea coast—while the sparsely peopled highlands of the same
countries are practically free.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is true of man is equally so of cattle. In the Gulf states
of this country, herds living in the open air are practically free
from tuberculosis, while in New Orleans and other large cities,
the cows shut up in the confined stables and yards, are as tuberculous
as those of the great cities of the north. So in many districts
in the northern states we find no bovine tuberculosis, while
in others, differing in no essential particular as regards geological
formation, altitude, exposure, and industrial use of the animal,
a large proportion are affected.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Virulence.</i> Tuberculosis has long been recognized as virulent.
“It is indicated in the Mishna and other Jewish works as rendering
the meat unfit for consumption, but to come to more modern
times, we find that throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries the flesh of tuberculous animals was excluded from
human food, alike by the civil and ecclesiastical laws of Europe.
Tuberculosis in cattle was erroneously identified with syphilis of
man, which made a frightful extension in the end of the fifteenth
century, spreading from the army of Charles VIII which had
been engaged in the siege of Naples. This conviction lasted
until it was disproved about 1782. Though mistaken in the
identity of the two diseases, the fact that for centuries the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>people and physicians both associated tuberculosis with a
malady so notoriously contagious as syphilis, speaks strongly for
the forcible evidence of contagion manifested at that time. Morgagni,
who must have begun practice about 1700 A. D., testifies
to the strong conviction of the contagious element in tuberculosis.
Indeed it became a common practice to isolate the consumptive
person from the public, and after his death to burn his clothes
and sometimes even the house, or at least to subject them to a
careful disinfection. It is recorded that in 1750, in Nancy, the
magistrates ordered the burning, in the public square, of the personal
property of a woman who had died of phthisis, from sleeping
in the bed of another consumptive person.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At Naples, a royal edict of September 20, 1782, prescribed
the sequestration of the phthisical, the disinfection of the rooms,
chattels, movables, books, etc., with vinegar, eau-de-vie, lemon
juice, sea-water, fumigations, etc., under a penalty of three years
at the galleys, or in the case of nobles, of three years imprisonment
and a fine of 300 ducats. A physician who failed to report
a case of consumption was fined 300 ducats for the first offense,
and banishment for ten years in case of a second. Any one assisting
in such evasion of the law was sent to prison for six
months.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Chateaubriand found that, in 1803, he could not sell his carriages
in Rome, because Mme. Beaumont, who had died of consumption,
had ridden in them three or four times. George Sand,
who was with the phthisical Chopin in Minorca in 1839, was refused
a lease of the house for the second month, and the price of
repainting and purifying was demanded. Later, in Barcelona,
they were assessed for the bed on which Chopin had slept, as the
police regulations prescribed it should be burned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This was not a mere survival of vulgar prejudice. Jacobi
tells us of a dog which died of consumption from eating the sputa
of his phthisical master. Laennec, the discoverer of auscultation,
and the great authority on pulmonary consumption, records that
he himself contracted a tuberculous nodule, through a wound
with a saw, while making a necropsy in a case of phthisis.
Laennec died of tuberculosis later, although he seemed to have
checked this lesion by caustics. Andral joins Laennec in enjoining
the greatest caution and cleanliness in taking care of, or associating
with persons having advanced tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>“Cullen, who started with a strong prejudice against the doctrine
of contagion, leaves us the following instance of its occurrence:
‘A young man predisposed to phthisis married a Dutch
girl of a sanguine temperament and good constitution. Some
days after the marriage the woman lost her fresh color and was
attacked by a bad cough; a month later she commenced spitting
blood. The physician advised her not to sleep in the same bed
with her husband, but she refused to follow his advice, and six
months later she died of phthisis. The servant who took care of
her and the domestic, who avoided, as far as possible, staying in
the sick chamber, both died of consumption.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wickmann, court physician in Hanover, in 1780, pronounces
emphatically for contagion. In Zurich, at that time, one death
in every six was from phthisis. The contagion of phthisis was
slow in its operation, and was, therefore, less evident than that
of plague, smallpox, scarlatina and other affections attended by a
skin eruption, but it was no less real and deadly. It was also
less frequently indirect, or carried from victim to victim by intermediate
agents. He cited instances of the transmission of consumption
from husband to wife and vice versa, and claimed that
the marriage of a phthisical person should be legally prevented.
As a means of preventing the disease, he proposed a strict surveillance
of establishments for the sale of old clothes, and the
avoidance of leaving infants with consumptives.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Valsalvi and Sarconi refused to make necropsies of persons
who had died of phthisis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Ruhling, of Gottingen, writing in 1774, of the disease in
animals, says: ‘The malady is transmitted to sound animals by
direct contact of animals standing side by side in the stall, and
licking each other, and breathing the expired air direct from the
diseased lungs; the frequenting of the same pastures will also
serve to propagate it.’ In Krunitz’s encyclopedia, published in
Berlin, in 1787, is the following: ‘The heifers show an ardent
desire for the male, and remarkably enough, do not become pregnant,
but part with the fruit of conception. When opened these
animals show the first stomach, kidneys and surface of the lungs,
covered with pustules like dried mulberries or in suppuration.
The affection is contagious, and communicates itself from one animal
to another by contact.’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>“Fromage, in the Dictionaire de Rozier, Article Phthisis, says:
‘Men of art are very much in accord that this malady is not contagious,
but some stock owners think differently.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Huzard, who saw much of tuberculosis in the Parisian dairies
in the concluding decade of the last century, said that most of
the veterinarians looked upon the disease as contagious, and that
some of the physicians believed the same of the phthisis of man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dewar, speaking of his experience in Scotland in 1839, and
succeeding years, in a particular herd, says: ‘The proprietor
agreed to remove partition walls, and to make openings opposite
one another in the outside walls, so that there might be a current
of fresh air passing through. These alterations combined with
cod liver oil, tonics and stimulants, may have prolonged life but
yet no cure was effected, and that herd died out. I resorted to
every precaution when new cattle were purchased to prevent
infection; as I had an idea, even at that time, that the disease
might be communicated from one to another when in immediate
contact. The precautions adopted when fresh cattle were purchased
had the desired effect, for in a few years afterward, they
were as good a lot of cattle as any in the district. That herd left
an impression on my mind that never can be effaced, and made
me always dread the evil consequences of tuberculosis. Having
practiced in the same locality, which is an extensive breeding and
rearing district, I have seen several herds decimated. Though I
have sometimes foretold the owner what he might expect, yet he
did not believe me until so many were infected that the byres
were infested with the fearful malady, and your remarks in regard
to nose contamination are so true that I do not think it possible
any can escape that are so exposed. I have also seen, as Grad
has, the same stall infecting beast after beast until a thorough
cleaning and disinfecting, with plenty of fresh air had removed all
infection.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Spinola, writing in 1858, of bovine tuberculosis, gives contagion
as a possible cause, and Lafosse, in 1867, says: ‘Physicians
begin in imitation of Morgagni to believe in the contagion of
phthisis. The facts published by Villemin appear to support
this opinion, which has been held by our colleague, Dupont, of
Bordeaux, for several years.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cruzel in his work of date, 1868, is much more positive; he
says: ‘This fœtid expired air, inhaled immediately by another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>cow upon a sound lung, gives the latter tuberculous infection.
It is a matter of every day experience to the veterinarian. Two
oxen or cows are kept in the same stable, take their food from a
common rack or manger, lie in the same stall, and respire nose
to nose. The one is, to all appearances, perfectly sound, the
other is in as good a condition, and is vigorous, but it coughs
from time to time, and its breath is foul. Soon we notice that
the animal that does not cough, eats with less appetite, he loses
flesh and soon he is unequivocally affected with the same malady
as the first.’ The foregoing quotations show clearly that in
spite of the misleading teachings of Broussais and others, the
doctrine of contagion in tuberculosis could not be overcome,
and that up to the time of the remarkable experiments of Villemin,
in 1865, it maintained its hold upon the minds of extensive
and careful observers. In animals, especially, the evidence was
so frequent and clear, animal following animal in the same stall,
and eating from the same infected manger, only to be infected in
turn, and two animals stalled together, and licking the same
manger with their prehensile tongues, transmitting the infection
with certainty the one to the other, were facts that could not possibly
be ignored. Other cattle in the same building might escape
for a length of time, but the eating in common from the same
fatal manger, by a tuberculous and a healthy animal, quickly
sealed the fate of the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Physicians, too, who were compelled to investigate the
causes of the extraordinary fatality from tuberculosis in the
armies and navies, could not shut their eyes to the fact notwithstanding
that they came to the task strongly prejudiced
through education against the acceptance of contagion. Thus,
Dr. Bryson, in his report to the Epidemiological Society, in 1860,
on consumption in the several ships of the English navy on the
Mediterranean station, says distinctly that the disease appeared
to be propagated by contagion. Dr. Parkes, quoting this in his
Practical Hygiene, says: ‘It may be inferred that pus cells were
largely thrown off during coughing, and floating through the
air, were received into the lungs of other persons. The production
of phthisis in animals confirms this view. The case of
monkeys in the zoological gardens, narrated by Dr. Arnot, is a
striking instance. Cows in close stables frequently die of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>phthisis. But not only phthisis may reasonably be considered
to have one of its modes of origin in the breathing of an atmosphere
contaminated by respiration, but other lung diseases, bronchitis
and pneumonia, appear also to be more common under
such circumstances.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Villemin in 1865, published his investigations in which he had
produced tuberculosis in a great number of animals, by inserting
particles of fresh tubercle or injecting the tuberculous sputa of
man into the subcutaneous connective tissues, the peritoneum
and the trachea. There resulted in nearly every case a chronic
disease, the marked phenomena of which were caseated centers
devolving from firm inflammatory nodules in the seat of inoculation,
in the adjacent lymphatic glands, in the lungs, serous membrane,
liver, spleen and kidneys. The centers of such nodules
were at first transparent and grayish, but soon the center underwent
necrobiosis, forming a soft cheesy mass the size of a pin’s
head, and gradually enlarging to that of a pea, a bean, a hazel
nut or larger. After a period of about 14 days the lymphatic
gland nearest the seat of injection could be felt as a firm pea-like
nodule, and in two weeks more a second gland on the line of
the lymph circulation, had become enlarged and nodular, while
the first, now the size of a large bean, had probably undergone
distinct softening. This became adherent to the skin, burst and
discharged continuously or at intervals with little or no tendency
to heal. If killed at this date, the animal showed only the open
sore and a chain of nodular pea-like caseated lymphatic glands
leading up from it. The lungs might be apparently sound, but
the spleen and liver usually showed miliary elevations on the surface,
with clear grayish centers, as viewed under a magnifying
glass, opaque patches were found on the omentum, and the lymphatic
glands of the mesentery, of the portal fissures of the liver
and of the Hilus of the spleen were distinctly enlarged and resistant.
If not killed, the subject usually died 100 to 120 days
after inoculation, and then the lungs were found studded with
tubercles miliary or larger and more or less caseated; the bronchial
mediastinal, subdorsal, pectoral, prepectoral, phrenic, mesenteric,
hepatic, and splenic lymphatic glands were more or less
enlarged and caseated, while the liver and spleen were enlarged
and studded with multiple tubercles. Guinea pigs give the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>extensive and intensive lesions, rabbits much less so, but in both
emaciation and wasting are very marked. In short the lesions
are essentially and unmistakably those of generalized tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At first, however, incredulity prevailed and experiments on a
large scale were inaugurated all over Europe and America to put
the question to crucial test. Martin, Conheim, Burdon-Sanderson,
Simon, Wilson, Fox, Lebert and Wyss, Fraënkel, Waldenbourg,
and others inoculated with all sorts of non-tuberculous
organic materials (bronchial mucus, foul pus, cancer juice, diseased
liver, simple cotton setons, etc.) and from these in Guinea
pigs there resulted local caseated foci, and implication of the
adjacent lymphatic glands. It was found that the liquids from
low types of pneumonia produced these apparently tubercular
deposits, while that from acute sthenic pneumonia did not; that
the cotton thread seton failed to produce the disease if it were
first steeped in carbolic acid, and that the lesion caused by breaking
a bone without injury to the skin failed to produce the
characteristic lesions even in the very susceptible Guinea pig.
It became evident, therefore, that the morbid results in these
cases, were due to accidental inoculations with the poison of the
tubercle, which is widely distributed, or with some pyæmic or
other germs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gradually the truth triumphed, and those who had at first
been loudest in their opposition were led by their own experiments
to become the firmest supporters of the new truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As early as 1874, Gerlach had experimented largely in feeding
the milk of tuberculous cows, and had infected calves, pigs,
sheep and rabbits in this way. Chauveau in (1874), Klebs (1873),
Semmer (1880) and Parrot (1870) fed calves, cats, Guinea pigs,
pigs, sheep and a variety of other species of animals with tuberculous
flesh or lungs, or saliva, producing tuberculosis in a large
proportion of cases. In this manner they escaped the charge of
the operation of a wound and of ærial bacteria, and yet succeeded
in producing infection. The lesions in this case began in the intestinal
mucous membranes and mesenteric glands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Another essay in the same direction was made by Tappeiner
(1878), who infected rabbits, Guinea pigs and dogs, by enclosing
them in boxes and compelling them to breathe tuberculous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>liquids intimately mixed with the air atomization. In these
cases lesions began in the lungs and bronchial and mediastinal
glands.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c023'><sup>[1]</sup></a>”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> The <i>bacillus tuberculosis</i>, the essential cause of
tubercle, was demonstrated by Koch in 1882. It was at first
supposed to be peculiar in its indisposition and tardiness to take a
stain, and in its retention of the stain once imparted, even when
it is treated with acids. Later observations have shown that
these characteristics are common to certain other bacilli, notably
to those of leprosy, smegma, and to specimens found in timothy
hay and other grasses, cow dung, milk and butter. These furnish
sources of fallacy in the milk and butter especially, but
when the specimens examined are taken from the interior of a
tubercle, lymph gland or serous cavity the danger of error may
be practically ignored. What is quite as important is the fact
that the tubercle bacillus is subject to evolutionary changes in
adapting itself to a habitat in different genera of animals, and to
a lesser extent in different parts of the same animal, by which its
pathogenesis is modified, but these variations do not materially
affect the staining qualities. Still more striking variations have
been found in old cultures, ovoid forms (Metchinkoff), club-shaped
microbes and filaments (Metchinkoff, Klein, etc.), branching
filaments (Fischl, Coppen Jones), divergent club-shaped
groups, like actinomyces (Babes and Levaditi). The last named,
seen in inoculated rabbits, have been held to establish a relationship
between the microbes of tuberculosis and actinomycosis, as
the club-shaped cells do not take the usual Ziehl-Neelsen stain
for tubercle bacilli, but the Birsch-Hirshfeld’s actinomyces stain.
Apart from the rabbit such variations are not likely to prove
sources of fallacy in identification of the microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Morphology.</i> As met with in the tubercle of man or ox the
bacillus is a minute rod with rounded ends, 1.5 to 3.5μ long, by
0.2μ in thickness. In the ox it is shorter and thicker on an
average than in man. They are usually solitary, but two and
exceptionally even three or four elements may be united. In
stained specimens unstained portions are frequently seen (spores?).
When cultivated on blood serum there is a tendency to form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>elongated rope-like colonies having a waving outline. Other
evolution forms have been already noted.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Staining.</i> The resistance to staining is overcome by a heated
alkaline watery solution of methylene blue (Koch), or better by
a carbolated solution of fuchsin (Ziehl-Neelsen). To a 5 per
cent. watery solution of carbolic acid add one tenth of its volume
of saturated alcoholic solution of fuchsin. The suspected
sputum or scraping from a section of a lesion is spread in a thin
layer on a cover glass by drawing over it the straight edge of a
second cover glass, dried in the air, and passed three times
through an alcohol flame with the smeared side up. It may then
be floated on the surface of the staining fluid with the specimen
side down, then gently heated for three or four minutes almost
to ebulition, drying being prevented by the addition of more of
the carbol-fuchsin solution as required. It is then washed in
water to remove excess of the staining fluid and treated with a
bleaching acid solution (sulphuric acid 5 per cent. or nitric acid
15 per cent.) When decolorized it is well rinsed in two or more
portions of a 60 or 70 per cent. alcohol and then in water. Next
stain with a 1 or 2 per cent. aqueous solution of methylene blue
for one minute and wash off the excess with water. The tubercle
bacilli will appear of a deep red and other bacteria blue.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Gabbett’s</i> counter-staining and decolorizing solution is especially
useful in economizing time. After staining, as above directed,
in the carbol-fuchsin solution for one minute, wash in water,
then cover with a solution of 2 grams methylene blue (powder)
in 100cc. of 10 per cent. sulphuric acid, until the film has a
faintly bluish tint: then wash thoroughly in water and examine.
Tubercle bacilli come out red, others blue.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>examination of tissues</i> the microscopic sections are steeped
for twenty-four hours in the carbol-fuchsin solution (or 1 hour at
a temperature of 45° to 50° C.), then decolorized in a 5 per cent.
sulphuric acid for a few seconds, then in a 70 per cent. alcohol:
they are then counter-stained in an aqueous solution of methylene
blue, washed in water dehydrated with absolute alcohol, cleared
up in xyol or oil of cedar, and mounted in Canada balsam.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Biology.</i> The <i>bacillus tuberculosis</i> is notorious for its variant
forms, assumed in adapting itself to given environments, and
which it retains with considerable tenacity for a time, even when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>placed in a new and different medium. It is largely held to be
an obligatory parasite, and incapable of survival as a saprophyte, yet
Straus, Nocard and others, have shown that the form obtained
from the tuberculosis of birds can easily be made to live in suitable
dead mixtures of organic matter. It is also notorious that
the bacillus taken direct from the tubercle of the mammal, and
which, as a rule, fails to grow at once in glycerined bouillon,
yet, after a first successful culture in the new medium, often
adapts itself completely, and thereafter it can in many cases be
transferred from bouillon to bouillon, with as great certainty as
it could formerly be inoculated from ox to ox. The difference
is one of habit and adaptability, rather than any primary and
permanent distinction of species. There is every reason to believe
that the microbe has lived, and under given conditions can
still be made to live as a saprophyte, with a greatly reduced
adaptability to parasitic life in the animal, just as we see to-day
that it is only with great difficulty transferred from certain genera
of animals to certain other genera (from bird to ox and vice
versa). Trudeau tells us of a culture of a bacillus tuberculosis
from man, inoculated on the rabbit and then cultivated <i>in vitro</i>
in successive generations for six years, that was in this way
robbed of its pathogenesis for Guinea pigs, which, after inoculation,
lived for many months, some two and a half years, and
some even recovered. The average duration of life in the
Guinea pig, after tuberculosis inoculation from man, rabbit,
Guinea pig or recent culture is but seventeen days. The bacillus
of human sputum often produces only localized tuberculosis in
the ox. Even in the same species and individual the pathogenesis
often varies materially. Nothing is more familiar than
the slow progress of tuberculosis in the bones and lymph glands
of man, on the one hand, and its frequently rapid progress in the
lungs, liver and brain, on the other. As inoculated on the lower
animals bacilli from the lungs of man are usually more virulent
than those from the lymph glands (Creighton, Arloing, F.
Craven Moore, Courmont and Denis). Among seven specimens
of human sputum, the bacilli in six cases showed a fair average
vitality, whereas those of the seventh failed to grow on blood
serum of the dog (Theobald Smith). In both man and cow a
large proportion of cases of tuberculosis remain localized, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>disease lasting for years with little or no appreciable advancement,
and not a few subjects appear to make a permanent recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'>On every hand this evolutionary tendency of the bacillus tuberculosis
places itself in evidence, demanding a recognition of the
fact, that more or less transient or lasting variations in accordance
with previous or existing environment, control to a large extent
the transmissibility of the disease among different genera and
even among individuals of the same genera and species, and also
the fatal progress, or the mild and evanescent issue of the infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the most widely divergent of these evolutionary forms can
often be made to approach each other and apparently merge into
one type. Profiting by the example of Metchnikoff, Nocard enclosed
in collodion capsules the bacilli of the human sputum and
inserted the capsules into the peritoneal cavity of chickens which
had proved refractory to their direct inoculation. This excluded
the direct action of the leucocytes from the encapsuled bacilli,
but allowed the endosmosis of the serum of the fowl for their
nourishment. After a sojourn of four months or more they were
transferred to other capsules and again enclosed in the peritoneum
and after a second and third transference of this kind it was found
that the bacillus had become actively pathogenic for the chicken,
having acquired the infecting potencies of the bacillus of avian
tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>In keeping with the above is the fact that both rabbit and horse
are easily infected by the bacillus obtained from birds, and that
after a certain number of transmissions through the rabbit the
issue of the bacilli of bird and mammal appear to become identical.
No less instructive are the cases of the infection of carp by human
sputa and the conveyance of tuberculosis to rabbits and Guinea
pigs by inoculation with the nodules of the infected carp.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>vitality</i> of bacillus tuberculosis is strong but variable. In
sterilized water at 46° to 64° F. the human bacillus survived for
fifty to seventy days (Chantemesse and Vidal), the bovine indefinitely
(Galtier) and the avian bacillus at a higher temperature
one hundred and seventeen days (Straus and DeBarry). In
dried expectoration the bacillus of man still infects after nine or
ten months (Koch, Schill, Fischer, De Thoma). In infected
cow’s lung, dried and pulverized, it infected Guinea pigs at 102
days (Cadeac and Malet). In putrid matter it infected after 43
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>days (Schill, Fischer), 167 days (Cadeac and Malet), several
years in a grave (Schottelius).</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not destroyed by gastric juice (Fischer, Falk). The
bacillus from tubercle of birds has a much greater vitality than
that of mammals. Marfucci successfully seeded new media from
a culture of two years old, and cultures in artificial media can be
started more successfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Full <i>sunlight</i> renders sputum on a solid nonabsorbent surface
noninfecting in several hours, varying according to the thickness
of the layer (Koch, Straus). When sputum is mixed in soil it
may survive until the 137th day (Feltz). On woolen cloth it may
live five hours (Migneco).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diffuse daylight</i>, with shading from the sun, killed in seven
days (Koch), to eighteen days (Lucibelli).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>X-Rays</i> do not arrest the growth of cultures (Blaikie, Pott,
Ausset).</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>dry temperature</i> of 212° F. for an hour left some of the
bacilli still infecting to Guinea pigs (Lartigan).</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>moist heat</i> of 140° F. for one hour sterilizes (De Man, Th.
Smith, etc.). The scum formed on the milk may still prove infecting
(Th. Smith). Half an hour of a moist temperature of
212° F. is sterilizing. Yet in the case of steaks, roasts and boiled
meats the size of the piece often prevents the reaching of this
temperature throughout, and it becomes unsafe to use any meat
in which the redness of the juice shows, that the albumen has not
all been fully coagulated (162° F.).</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>freezing temperature</i>, −16° to −26° F., does not devitalize
the bacilli, even when alternated with thawing at intervals for
several weeks (Galtier, Cadeac and Malet).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Heavy salting</i> of meats has been thought to kill the bacillus in
a month. After 15 days in salt the microbe failed to kill rabbits,
but still killed the Guinea pig, whereas after 30 days it killed
neither (Galtier). The fact that salted meats are always unequally
impregnated in different parts, renders this extremely unreliable
and more of a snare than a guide.</p>

<p class='c008'>The action of chemical disinfectants varies not only with the
agent but also with the medium in which the bacillus is found.
In simple liquid media (bouillon) the following results were obtained:</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ACCESSORY CAUSES OF TUBERCULOSIS IN ANIMALS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>While recognizing that in the absence of the tubercle bacillus
there can be no tuberculosis yet we must not ignore the fact that
many conditions of the animal system and its environment contribute
largely to the propagation of the disease on the one hand,
or to hinder its progress on the other. None of these conditions
can call the germ into being <i>de novo</i>, but in its presence, they
greatly favor its diffusion or even its malignancy. Like any other
seed, this bacillus requires a suitable soil and favorable climate, to
bring out its most destructive development. In striking the balance,
we have to guard against the error of so many, who would
attribute to the germ alone the deadly results and who assume
that these should be the same under all conditions, and the opposite
error no less prevalent, that ascribes the evil to the conditions,
and holds that without these the germ would be harmless.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Hereditary Predisposition. Racial Vulnerability.</i> Before the
discovery of the specific bacillus, when as yet tuberculosis was
held to result from a constitutional weakness, or cachexia in which
deterioration of cells was held to be the main factor, the disease
was held to be mainly hereditary, and its every day transmission
in the line of descent, and the increasing mortality to extinction
of given families were confidently appealed to in support of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>doctrine. Now, however, we recognize that congenital tuberculosis
in man or beast is very exceptional, and that the morbid
process almost invariably takes its start from the germ implanted
after birth. In Saxony when the tuberculous cows were 16.5
per cent. tuberculous calves were but .2 per cent., though the
latter had been fattened on the milk of the former. In Munich
but two calves were found tuberculous in 400,000 killed, and in
Lyons but five in a similar number. Up to the present the
number of calves recorded as tuberculous at birth does not exceed
seventy.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the young almost always contracted the disease, only after
birth, virtually disposes of the alleged heredity of the tuberculosis
but it by no means antagonizes the heredity of the racial vulnerability.
As man, cattle, swine and Guinea pigs show a much greater
vulnerability than the carnivora in general, so certain families in
each of these genera show a more decided susceptibility to tuberculosis
under similar conditions than do certain other families. This
goes far to explain the appearance of tuberculosis, in certain lines
of blood, and its advance to the extinction of the family, while
under no better environment, other families can count on a practical
immunity. In the Burden herd of Jerseys in 1877, I condemned
eleven animals, verifying my diagnosis by necropsies, and
found to my surprise that I had taken every representative, even
the grades, of a given family, and left all the pure bred members
of a second family untouched. Both families had mingled freely
in the pastures and yards, yet the second family furnished no
cases of tuberculosis then nor for many years afterward. The
case is all the more striking that the non-tuberculous family gave
the largest yield of milk and might have been expected to run
down rather than the other on account of this drain.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Close Buildings. Lack of Ventilation.</i> Air rendered impure
by being breathed again and again, predisposes strongly to tuberculosis,
and has been even looked upon as the sole cause (Macormac).
Everywhere city dairy cows, kept in confined, close
buildings, suffer severely (6 to 20 per cent. and upward); in Berlin
75 per cent. (Ostertag); in Denmark 61 per cent. (Bang),
while in the same districts country cows are comparatively immune
(often 1 to 2 per cent.), and steers raised in the open air
still less (0.02 per cent. for our Plains cattle). For the slighter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>cases of tuberculosis in man and beast, life in a pure open air,
day and night, in a genial climate, gives the best hope of improvement
or recovery. In the Burden Jersey herd above referred
to, animals condemned in spring as tuberculous, were
turned out to pasture during the summer where they maintained
an appearance of robust health, yet when returned to the barns in
fall they fell off rapidly, so that some had to be helped to rise in
the stall. “The stabled cow, the tame rabbit, the monkey, the
caged lion, tiger or elephant are almost invariably cut off by
scrofulous affection” (Aitken). It has long been noticed that
sailors sleeping in close spaces (Bryson, Parkes), soldiers confined
to close stone barracks even in the tropics (Parkes), suffer much
more than the officers in more spacious rooms (Clark). Monks
and nuns (two-thirds of the deaths, Leudet) occupying confined
cells, and the inmates of prisons (four times the average outside,
Baer) have shown an extraordinary prevalence of tuberculosis
and attendant mortality. While this can be attributed mainly to
the preservation and concentration of the bacillus in such places,
a considerable allowance must be made for the impure and rebreathed
air.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dark, Foul, Damp Stables.</i> Dark stables are usually close,
dirty and damp as well, and all these conditions alike conduce to
tuberculosis. Darkness hinders the development of organic
coloring matter in living bodies, whether chlorophyll in plants or
hæmoglobin in the blood of animals. Hæmoglobin is the main
oxygen carrier in the blood, and in case of its deficiency the tissues
are not properly ærated. The result is as if the inhaled air
contained little oxygen, so that darkness further intensifies the
evil of rebreathed, deoxygenated air. The extraordinary mortality
from tubercle among prisoners, monks, nuns and miners
serves to further accentuate this conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Trudeau’s experiment with rabbits is instructive in this connection.
Of a number inoculated with the same number of
tubercle bacilli, one half were kept in the open air and the rest
in a dark, damp, underground place deprived of sunlight. When
killed on the same day, it was found that the open air rabbits
showed only slight lesions or none, while the underground lot had
extensive tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>The impure stable air lowers the vital tone of the animal,
especially if the impurity has come from animal exhalations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same is true of damp air, “a damp ship is an unhealthy
one,” and Bowditch and Buchanan pointed out the especial prevalence
of tubercle in cold, damp, undrained, foggy localities.
This does not hold for all damp lands, yet damp, fog, and cold
are especially hurtful in presence of the germ.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>INSUFFICIENT OR UNWHOLESOME FOOD.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Starvation and indigestible or innutritious food contribute to
debility, and lessen the power of resistance. Hence in the poor,
half starved denizens of city slums, and among neglected herds
of cattle, tuberculosis, once introduced, makes rapid and extensive
ravages. Conversely overfeeding often acts in the same
way, developing indigestion and thereby robbing the tissues of
their proper nourishment.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HEAVY MILKING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In dairy cows, of milking breeds, the drain on the system is
liable to prove too great, under a ration-for-milk, warm sloppy
mashes of grains, bran, middlings, roots, distillery swill, exclusive
diet of silage, saccharine roots, or marc, warm drinking water, a
warm atmosphere, liberal salting, and enforced idleness in the
stall, with careful stripping of the bag. The butter cows,
(Jerseys, Guernseys, Alderneys, etc.) are especially liable to
suffer, as the greater the yield the more the system is robbed of
the adipose material which is so needful to a vigorous health.
When the cow has been reduced to a high-pressure milk factory
her physical size reduced to obviate the need of a large sustaining
ration, and her milking capacity stimulated to the highest degree,
the presence of the tubercle bacillus is especially dangerous.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CONFORMATION.</h3>

<p class='c015'>It was formerly held that cows with heads narrow between the
horns, small thin necks, narrow chests defective also in depth and
length, loose projecting shoulders and elbows, pendent, pot bellies,
with hollow flanks, and a general laxity of the frame were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>especially predisposed to tubercle. In many such cases the suspected
animal was already the victim of the affection, which had
brought out these characteristic features of weakness and emaciation.
In other cases the unthrifty appearance was due to poor
feeding and care or to chronic disease, which in robbing the system
of vigor and hardihood laid it open to the attack of the
tubercle bacillus whenever it was introduced. Even when there
was no such depressing influence affecting the individual, the
inheritance of such a frame, betokened a constitution lacking in
vigor, and with little power of resistance to the invading microbe.
Some milking breeds which tend to the above conformation, show
an unusual development of the lymph glands and plexuses, and
as tuberculosis attacks the lymphatic system preëminently, the
bacillus finds an especially favorable field for development in
such systems. It would, however, be an error to assume that the
compact, rounded frame, with circular chest and abdomen, and
full, firm neck and shoulders, with a great disposition to fat and
little to milk, is in any degree immune. Under the presence of
the tubercle bacillus, and close stabling, they often succumb quite
as rapidly as the most susceptible milking breeds. The meat producing
breeds with a strong propensity to fatten, have an extraordinary
development of lymph spaces and plexus in the intermuscular
and subcutaneous connective tissue, and the microbe
finds a welcome home in their sluggish, inactive and atonic systems
as well as in the typical dairy cows.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BREEDING TOO YOUNG.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Breeding from immature animals undermines the vitality as
the system is overtaxed to sustain at once the demands for further
growth, for the nourishment of the unborn offspring, and for the
yield of milk. Some families of Jerseys have been undoubtedly
injured in this way, through the desire to diminish the size of
the cow, and yet retain the highest milk and butter yield.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CLOSE BREEDING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Inbred families are proverbially subject to tuberculosis. By
pairing individuals that show in a marked degree the desired
qualities of early maturity, heavy milking, or fattening, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>greatest stimulus is given to the enhancement of such qualities,
and with this there is the correspondingly ready receptiveness to
the tubercle bacillus. To this is added a degree of constitutional
delicacy which comes from too close breeding, and which otherwise
shows itself in an encreasing infertility, when bred with an
animal that is nearly related. In addition, the high bred animal
is kept much indoors, where the bacillus, once introduced, is
easily preserved and propagated, and is denied the free outdoor
life and exercise which might develop muscle and vigor. This
is no valid argument for introducing inferior blood to the deterioration
of the economic value of a race, but rather for the complete
exclusion of the bacillus which may find in our treasured
herd an especially inviting field for its ravages.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>AGE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In both man and beast, age appears to have a predisposing
effect, but apart from debility or trauma, this may be fully explained
on the ground of often repeated infection, an indoor life,
and, in dairy cows, the excessive drain upon the system. In
thoroughbred herds of cattle, in which the cows are preserved as
long as they will breed, and in dairies where they are kept as
long as the milk yield is satisfactory, the oldest show by far the
largest percentage tuberculous. In secluded individual dairies
we have found 100 per cent. affected, Ostertag gives the average
for Berlin at 75 per cent., and Bang for Denmark at 69 per cent.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PREDISPONENT DISEASES.</h3>

<p class='c015'>As already noted all diseases which undermine the health tend
to diminish the powers of resistance to the tubercle bacillus. To
be especially dreaded, are long standing diseases which produce
emaciation and debility, fevers that for a length of time impair
sanguification, metabolism and nutrition, diseases of the digestive
organs which cut off the requisite supply of nutritive material,
and, above all, diseases of the lungs and air passages that impair
the tone of the tissues and invite the attack of the invading microbe.
Bronchitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis and tonsilitis in all
their varied forms are to be particularly noted. Even in man it
is believed that one of the most common channels of infection
entrance is through the open tonsillar crypts, and the same doubtless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>is true of animals. Pigs, with their large tonsils and frequent
infection through feeding, are probable examples of this,
and when, in addition to the detention of the microbe in the cavities,
there is an inflammation and debility of the tissues, the opportunity
for infection is greatly enhanced.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ENCREASED TRAFFIC IN (TUBERCULOUS) ANIMALS. DAIRY EXTENSION.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In common with all infectious diseases, tuberculosis owes
its great extensions to the sale and purchase of animals. Where
an indigenous race of cattle is raised and sold, without any additions
from without, tuberculosis is usually rare and confined to
the one herd, or to those having intimate intercommunication
with it. Where, on the other hand, a large stock is kept up, as
in milk dairies, and few or no calves are raised, but the bulk of
the cows are sold off yearly and replaced by new purchases,
tuberculosis, sooner or later, finds admittance through the body
of an infected animal, and once implanted in the herd, it goes on
encreasing, without limitation, except by the sale or death of the
more seriously affected. The larger the herd and the greater the
number of yearly changes, the greater the number of opportunities
for the introduction of an infecting animal. Where a great
part of the herd is turned off yearly, and the new animals are
drawn from any or every source indiscriminately, it would border
on the miraculous if such a herd were to remain free from the
infection for any great length of time. The recent extension of
tuberculosis in herds has been coincident with the great development
of commerce in live stock, and the rapid transit on land and
water by steam. Before the days of the steam engine, animal
plagues advanced slowly and uncertainly, excepting in the presence
of a great European war, which drew animals from all available
sources, congregating them in large mutually infecting
droves in commisariat parks, and marching them in the wake of
the army for its daily supply. Inevitably every country invaded
was infected, and the plagues spread from the line of march in
all directions. The more deadly plagues, like rinderpest and
lung plague, were the first to appear, and in this lay a certain
measure of palliation of the evil, as the exposed and often weaker
animals were killed off, so that the slower contagion like that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>tuberculosis had not time to develop. This mitigating influence
held good so long as the deadly plagues were not placed under
effective control. When, however, a nation successfully extirpated
and excluded lung plague and rinderpest, the way was
opened for a freer extension of tardily developing plagues like
tuberculosis. The great development of beet sugar factories and
the accumulation of herds to consume the marc; the extraordinary
extension of manufactures which have made England and
certain countries of Western Europe consuming rather than agricultural
lands, and the wonderful modern expansion of dairy
husbandry have combined to encrease and concentrate the cattle
industry in ratio with the manufacturing and commercial progress
of the nations, and as the live stock are kept under a milk-stimulating
regimen and a life passed largely indoors, the way has
been open for an ever-advancing encrease of tuberculosis. In the
United States the centralization of population in the Eastern
States and in all great centres of industry and the concentration
of cows for the milk supply, and in certain districts in connection
with butter and cheese factories, have contributed to wide local
extensions of consumption. Hence it has been no uncommon
thing to find herds in the vicinity of cities with 20 to 100 per
cent. affected, in striking contrast with the 0.02 per cent. found
in the fat cattle from the plains.</p>

<p class='c008'>The modern railway traffic brings to all these swarming centres
of animal industry, live cattle from long distances to supply the
constant depletion through deaths and the disposal of dry cows,
and thus the whole Atlantic slope is drawn upon to fill the eastern
stalls. Infected animals thus shipped from Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan for the good of the herds in
those states find new homes in New York, or New England,
where they have four to twelve mouths to propagate the infection
before they are themselves disposed of. As in the days of the
lung plague in America, the eastward trend of bovine traffic,
becomes to a certain extent a protection and benefit to the herds
of the west, but in equal ratio it operates to the detriment of our
eastern stock. What is true of the planting of new centres of
infection in the busy dairy districts of the east, and of the steady
increase of disease in already infected herds, through the constant
addition of new cases purchased, is no less true of the corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>districts devoted to dairying interests in the west. It
is the natural order of things, that, everywhere, the new accessions
of infection, coming in the lines of trade, into large dairy
herds, kept to a great extent indoors for months at a time, must
hasten the general infection of such herds. When, therefore, no
intelligent measures are interposed to check the evil, we must
expect that the marked increase in the prevalence of tuberculosis,
which we have witnessed of late years, shall become more and
more evident year by year. Journals have claimed credit for befriending
the stockman, in opposing all control of the cattle traffic,
dealers have denounced all control as ruinously oppressive and
injurious, and legislators have turned a deaf ear to the warnings
of science and experience, but time, in this as in all
other plagues, will justify the demand for an intelligent control,
and the increasing losses will one day open the eyes of the stockowners
to the fact that their truest friends are those that would
exclude the baneful seed, and kill it ere it has had time to germinate
and bring forth its ever increasing harvests.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the absence of any systematic and efficient government protection
in this line, the stock owner can only protect his sound
herd by the rigid exclusion of all animals that are not of his own
breeding, or in case of purchase, by an exhaustive inquiry as to
the occurrence of sickness or deaths in the herd from which he
buys, and by the professional examination and test of every animal
to be bought. Even then he must promptly separate, test,
and, if necessary destroy any animal that proves unthrifty, or
which by cough, diarrhœa, wheezing or other sign gives evidence
of probable tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Unregulated Traffic in Tuberculous Animals from Other States.</i>
The danger of buying animals untested is in no degree lessened
when they are sent in from other states. While some make a business
of supplying the store market with what they believe to be
good stock, there is always the temptation to turn off animals that
are unthrifty or poor milkers and which have proved less profitable
than the others. Some even have the herd tested and sell
off those that show evidence of tuberculosis. Unless, therefore,
it is held in check by the tuberculin test, the traffic is made to the
extent of such sales a direct means of disseminating tuberculosis.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>ASSORTING THE TUBERCULOUS ANIMALS FOR SALE IN A GIVEN STATE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A still more injurious result comes from the order of given
States, that the admission of store cattle shall be guarded by the
tuberculin test of each animal, and the supineness or worse, of
adjacent states in establishing no effective safe guard against the
disposal of the tuberculous culls in the unprotected State. Cattle
from the west or elsewhere in the United States, arrive in a great
public market as, for example, New York, they are here tested,
those that stand the test are shipped into one of the States requiring
the test (Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Canada), and those that have shown the reaction of tuberculosis
are sold into the herds of the State in which they were tested.
The most malicious enemy of the New York stock owners, could
not devise a surer means of stocking the herds of the State with
tuberculosis than this atrocious system. Yet when the present
writer had a bill introduced into the legislature to correct the evil
the opposing interest proved strong enough to prevent it from
coming to a vote. The legislative committee on tuberculosis
which sat later, and upon whose attention the subject was pressed,
also practically ignored it and the statute which this commission
inspired leaves the matter as bad as before. Under the present
law the New York purchaser must secure his own interests by
having every animal he buys tested by a trustworthy veterinarian.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sale of Sound Animals Concentrates the Tuberculosis.</i> The
action of one or more States in admitting store cattle only after a
tuberculin test, acts directly in encreasing the relative number
of tuberculous animals in adjacent States. The purchaser from
Pennsylvania for instance, goes into a New York herd and purchases
all the best animals on the condition that they pass the
tuberculin test uncondemned. It follows that the New York herd
is left with the tuberculous cattle only, and those that, aside from
tuberculosis, are of low value or profitless to keep. Further as
the advance of tuberculosis is proportionate to the relative number
of tuberculous subjects in the herd or building, and the concentration
of the poison, the depreciated herd is almost certain to
become rapidly and generally affected by the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The Denial of Indemnity for Tuberculous Animals Killed.</i>
Several American States (and notoriously New York in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>recently enacted statute) forbid compensation to the owner for any
animal killed because it is affected with a contagious disease, and
to prevent the extension of such contagion. All history attests,
and any consideration of human nature might teach, that such a
measure is only calculated to spread the infection. The owner of
an animal, affected with a contagious disease, who can get little
salvage by turning it into beef, and none at all if he hands it over
to the State for slaughter, will naturally think of putting it on
the market, where he can secure a good price. How much more
is he tempted to do this when the disease is an occult one, and the
animal shows the outward appearance of health, as is the case in
nine-tenths of many tuberculous herds! Crime cannot be fixed
on the seller, for he is not an expert, and cannot be expected to
diagnose the disease. If the infected cow is of little value for the
dairy, she is passed on, from hand to hand, leaving infection in
every herd she has entered. The ultimate owner (in whose
hands the State finds her and diagnoses her disease), though he
may have bought her in good faith as a sound animal and paid a
correspondingly high market price, is made to lose the whole
value of the cow. The real offender who knew her to be a tuberculous
animal, and sold her in consequence at the price of a sound
cow is shrewd enough to keep himself out of the clutches of the
law, while the honest purchaser who has been already swindled,
has his income and property cut off without compensation. Such
a law is self-evidently unjust; it plays into the hands of the
swindler at the expense of the just man; with the object of protecting
the community against infection, it refuses to call on the
public for any contribution toward its own protection. The
system is a direct bid for extensive and encreasing violation of
the law and diffusion of the infection and must be accorded a
prominent place in the list of causes. It would be surprising to
find that any country ever extirpated an animal plague by working
on such a system. As a matter of fact no country ever did; all
such sanitary successes from the extinction of sheeppox or rinderpest
in Western Europe, to the recent <i>stamping out</i> of lung plague
in the United States, were based on a just compensation to the
owners of the stock. When, therefore, veterinary sanitary
principles and experience have been so far ignored as to allow the
passage of a law, which at once favors the diffusion of infection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>by the crafty sale of the infected, the expatriation of the healthy
animals from the home herds, leaving only the diseased, and
finally the selection from herds in transit of the tuberculous ones
to be scattered widely among the herds of the State, we must not
wonder at the continuance or encrease of tuberculosis in the commonwealth.
Until a more rational and common sense legislation
can be secured, the unfortunate stock owner must defend himself
by the expensive alternative of testing every animal he buys.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Private Testing of Herds and Sale of the Tuberculous.</i> A most
reprehensible practice is the private testing of herds and the sale
as store animals of those that react. In this way a herd may be
cleared of infection, but at tenfold expense to the public at large,
as every animal sold may convey the infection into a separate
herd. It is, however, a natural outcome of the unwise system of
refusing indemnity for the infected.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Habituating to Tuberculin Testing and then Selling under
Test.</i> Many (not all) cattle, when injected with tuberculin repeatedly
at short intervals, acquire a tolerance of the agent and
fail to react as at the first test. We have in such cases examined
the animals <i>post mortem</i> and found active tuberculosis. Unscrupulous
owners, aware of the fact, have their diseased cattle injected
repeatedly every few weeks, and as soon as they fail to
respond, sell them under the guarantee of the tuberculin test.
The cattle, of course, carry the infection into other herds. This
swindle could be obviated if it could be made a misdemeanor to
have or use tuberculin except as a State or Federal official acting
for the government. This would imply the corollary that the
State should test the herds when called upon.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Antipyretics During Tuberculin Test.</i> Another method of undoing
the tuberculin test is to feed large doses of antithermic
agents to depress the temperature at the time the rise from tuberculin
would take place. Tuberculous cattle may thus be sold as
sound animals, with a certificate of having successfully passed
the tuberculin test, the operator having given such certificate in
perfect good faith. It suggests the importance of withholding
tuberculin from public use, or of securing an absolute control of
the feeding and watering of the animals during the test.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>False Certificates of Tuberculin Tests.</i> Stock owners have reported
to the writer alleged tuberculin tests of their herds which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>were completed in three hours, and others have named instances
of marking animals for shipment and giving certificates of testing
where no tuberculin had been used and no examination beyond
the most cursory glance had been made. This might be expected
of some non-graduates, registered on a basis of alleged practice,
shamefully ignorant of veterinary medicine and conscious of their
false position, and some educated veterinarians thus placed at a
disadvantage may have been tempted to follow suit, but it can
only end in personal disgrace and an inevitable extension of
tuberculosis. Begotten in a legislative wrong and nourished by
moral weakness, it can only grow into greater evil. Unfortunately
such unworthy actions throw discredit on the very name
of sanitary police. To avoid the evil every one aspiring to the
responsible work of testing cattle should be thoroughly examined
as to fitness and licensed to practice under a heavy penalty for
neglect or malpractice.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Feeding Hogs on Fresh Offal from Abattoirs.</i> It has been a
common practice, especially in country districts, to turn the raw
offal of slaughterhouses to pigs, and as the tubercle is usually
concentrated in internal organs, the hogs become infected in large
numbers. In public institutions which slaughtered their own
meat I have found the hogs all but universally tuberculous. The
danger is only slightly lessened when the hogs are fed raw
butcher and kitchen scraps in swill. It suggests the compulsory
boiling of all swill or garbage containing raw meat.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Feeding Calves and Hogs on infected Milk.</i> Though it has been
repeatedly shown that the majority of moderately tuberculous
cows do not yield infected milk, yet in every tuberculous herd, at
irregular intervals, one or more are attacked with tuberculosis of
the mammæ, and the drinkers of the milk take in the tubercle
bacilli. This will happen in the most strictly supervised tuberculous
herds, while in those that are less carefully managed, the
milk that is considered unfit for human consumption is fed to pigs
or calves. In one dairy, I found that the calves, all fed in this
way afterward reacted under the tuberculin test, while the following
year the crop of calves, though fed on the milk of the same
diseased cows, with this difference that the milk had been first
heated to 180° F., without exception grew up healthy, and not
one reacted under the tuberculin test.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span><i>Feeding hogs after Tuberculous Cattle.</i> Where cattle and hogs
are kept on the same place, it is a common practice to let the
swine clean up all food left by the satiated cattle. If there are
tuberculous cattle, affected either in the air passages or alimentary
tract, the pigs become infected by taking in the expectoration
by which the food is soiled, or by rooting around where
the cow manure has fallen.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Feeding from a Common Trough.</i> In an infected herd, a
common cause of extension is found in the use by the whole herd
of a common feeding trough, in which the food soiled by virulent
discharges, is taken by healthy animals. The habit of tying
a cow in different stalls in succession as she happens to strike one,
in place of keeping each cow by its own stall is a fruitful source
of infection. Even when each cow is kept by its own stall, she
often becomes infected by reaching into the feeding trough in
front of the next cow on the left or right and taking in soiled
and infected fodder. In swill stables the evil reaches its maximum,
as the feeding trough for 50 or 60 animals is slightly inclined
so that the liquid food runs from the supply end to the
other, and infecting expectorations are carried in front of all in
turn.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dry, Dusty Stables.</i> Tubercle bacilli are not carried out on
the expired air, unless there is forced expulsion as in coughing,
snorting or sniffing. In such cases the solid particles are thrown
off in masses or fine spray and lodged on surrounding objects.
These, together with infecting discharges from bowels, urinary
or generative organs, open sores, etc., dry up, and rise on the
dust, and, as sterilization occurs slowly indoors, they cause more
or less infection of the animal inmates. Cornet, Tappenier and
others have thoroughly established this as a common form of
transmission, and shown the great importance of cleanliness, disinfection
and the removal of infecting materials without raising
dust. In an establishment in Paris, a consumptive had served
for 3 years. In the following 10 years, 15 of the 20 employés
died of phthisis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Extension through Vermin.</i> As rats and mice (and other
rodents) are susceptible to tuberculosis by ingestion (Galtier) it
follows that they may become the media for extension of the
infection through fodder in which their droppings are scattered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>or from their feeding in the same troughs as the cattle or
swine. For swine in particular the danger is greater because
of their carnivorous habits; the rat acquires tuberculosis through
eating the offal of the abattoir, or the scraps of the butcher’s stall,
or kitchen, and the sick rat is thereafter easily caught and devoured
by the pig to its own undoing. To block this channel
of infection the destruction of vermin about slaughter houses,
stables and pig pens is a most important consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Flies and Other Insects as Carriers of Tuberculosis.</i> These congregating
on tubercular sores, around the nares or lips, on the
skin contaminated by the virulent bowel discharges, on dishes
holding infecting milk, on objects soiled by infecting discharges,
on diseased carcasses at abattoirs, rendering works and elsewhere,
(Spillman, Hoffmann, Lartigan, etc.,) and on graves where the
earth worms have brought the bacillus to the surface, (Lortet, etc.)
become more or less active agents in disseminating the virus. In
this way food and water are contaminated, and exceptionally, infection
may even be implanted on sores. As the excreta of the
flies contain the virulent bacilli, the latter are deposited on
windows, walls, furniture, etc., and may be later disseminated in
the dust of the apartment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dewevre found tubercle bacilli in the bedbugs infesting a bed
in which successive cases of consumption had developed, showing
that other parasitic or rapacious insects besides flies must be
looked on as possible propagators of the bacilli. There is reason
to suspect, lice, fleas, ticks and acari especially. The same is
true of leeches and other rapacious invertebrates.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LESIONS. THE TUBERCLE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The characteristic lesion in tuberculosis is the tubercle, taking
its name from the small rounded nodule which, at first virtually
invisible, encreases often to the size of a millet seed, or a pinhead
or even larger, and which by confluence with others, forms conglomerate
masses of all sizes to which the term tubercle is still
applied. Where the bacillus tuberculosis is implanted, the
fixed tissue cells are stimulated to an undue proliferation, and a
diapedesis of leucocytes takes place from the neighboring capillary
blood vessels, the whole eventuating in the formation of a rounded
cluster or nest of epithelioid and giant and later small rounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>lymphoid cells in a fine fibrous stroma. Baumgarten and his
followers claim that the larger epithelioid and giant cells result
from the karyokinesis and proliferation of the fixed tissue cells,
epithelial and endothelial cells, and that the lymphoid cells which
later (often after the eighth day in experimental cases) invade
the lesions, are alone the product of the migrating leucocytes.
Metchnikoff, Yersin and others contend, on the other hand, that
epithelioid and giant cells are directly derived from the leucocytes
and endothelial cells and like these are possessed of actively
phagocytic qualities. As the final outcome before caseous degeneration,
is the great predominance of the small lymphoid cell,
it may well be questioned whether this is not the result of active
encrease in both kinds of cells, as appears to happen in many
other inflammations. For our present purpose it is well to note
the early characters: <i>Centrally</i> often a large (giant) cell with a
number of peripheral nuclei and at times, branching processes;
around this as a <i>second zone</i> epithelioid cells of large size, with
round or oval nuclei, and sometimes giant cells; outside this a
<i>third zone</i> of small rounded lymphoid cells with large nuclei.
There is a delicate fibrous network between the cells, but no indication
of capillary blood vessels, the absence of which may
partly explain the constant tendency to degeneration, necrosis,
and caseation. The tissue around the miliary tubercle is red and
congested.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Caseation.</i> A striking characteristic of tubercle is the occurrence
of coagulation necrosis, beginning in the centre of the specific
nodule as a whitish or pale softening and degeneration of the cell
elements and gradually extending toward the circumference. The
cells, and even the proximate tissue elements, die and disintegrate
passing into a structureless, granular or hyaline debris, which has
been named from its supposed resemblance to old, ripe, soft
cheese. Baumgarten has observed that the small lymphoid cells
are the first to degenerate, followed by the epithelioid and giant
ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the formation of tubercle is at first a productive inflammation
of which the cell clusters and nodules are the result, yet
the tendency to necrosis, and caseation is so great that it must be
looked upon as one of its most prominent features, and is rarely
absent, whether the lesion exists in the connective tissue of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>lungs, liver or other organ, in the lymph glands, in the respiratory
or intestinal mucosa or submucosa, in the osseous cancelli, brain
or skin. It is, therefore, largely pathognomonic, yet it is not
peculiar to tubercle, being common in glanders, and other infective
inflammations. Its presence should always lead to a search
for the primary tubercle nodule, with its nonvascular cluster of
lymphoid and giant cells and above all for the specific bacillus
resistant to staining.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tendency to extensive degeneration and caseation is especially
marked in swine, in which the resulting debris is often so liquid
that the tubercles bear a strong resemblance to abscesses.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Calcification.</i> The deposition of lime salts (mainly phosphates)
in the tubercle is a common feature of advanced cases in man and
pig, but especially in cattle. It is unknown in rabbits and Guinea
pigs. The tubercle assumes a hard cretaceous aspect and feeling,
grates under the knife and crepitates when pressed. This is
always an evidence of chronicity, but it has been observed in
swine in 3½ months.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fibroid Degeneration. Fibrosis.</i> In this case a productive
fibroid inflammation takes place in the tissue of the tubercle, and
it is resolved more or less extensively into a hard, white, resistant
body. This is the pearly mass which has given rise to the name
of the <i>pearl disease</i> (perl-zucht) in Germany. It may be fibrous
throughout, but usually a number of the nodules show a caseated
centre while the external zone, that nearest to healthy tissue, has
alone taken on the conservative fibroid development. Like cretifaction,
fibrosis is an indication of chronicity in the lesion. It is
often seen in man, but still more so in cattle, in which it affects
particularly the abdominal cavity, but also to a lesser extent the
chest and other parts. It is remarkable for the paucity of
bacilli to be found in its substance, often requiring many sections
and infinite patience to reveal the presence of the microbe.
This comparative lack of actively multiplying bacilli is doubtless
one factor, operating in the direction of conservative processes,
chronicity and even partial recovery. In experimental tuberculosis
the extent and rapidity of development of tubercle, as also
of the degeneration are found to be closely allied to the number
of bacilli introduced.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cattle: Pulmonary Tuberculosis.</i> One of the most frequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>seats of tuberculosis, the lung, may in acute cases show a diffuse
miliary tuberculosis, a considerable part of a lobe or of several
lobes being congested, infiltrated, and filled with small individual
tubercles, grayish or transparent in the midst of the general redness.
A second form, often of old standing, is in the shape of
hard masses, often circumscribed or isolated, and easily felt when
the soft lung tissue is manipulated. They are respectively formed
by the local aggregation, and confluence of the small miliary
nodules and may vary in size from a pea to a mass of ten or
twelve inches in diameter. On section the miliary tubercle may
not yet show central caseation, but the larger ones do so as a
rule. The caseated nucleus may be soft, cheesy and somewhat
homogeneous; it may be dry, granular and yellow, resembling
damp farina of maize; it may be calcified in its outer portion and
invested by a firm fibrous envelope. The tubercle may be the seat
of general fibroid degeneration, constituting the pearl nodules
(perl-knoten) dense as cartilage and either with or without a soft
caseated centre; it may show an agglomeration of nodules in all
stages from the early congested nodule to advanced caseation or
cretefaction, the whole embedded in a solid congested and infiltrated
tissue, largely fibroid. There may be extensive abscesses,
the seats of complex infections, having thick uneven walls, often
showing <i>grape like</i> tuberculous outgrowths, and containing thick,
caseopurulent, viscous, granular, yellowish or greenish and
comparatively odorless contents; in other cases the abscesses
have burst into the bronchia, leaving <i>vomicæ</i> and with the new
resultant infections the contents have acquired an offensive putrid
odor; finally, there may be extensive inflammatory infiltrations,
affecting lobules or lobes, and interspersed with tubercles in the
form of the early grayish or transparent nodule, or even more
advanced caseous or cretaceous centres. These latter serve to
distinguish the condition from broncho-pneumonia, the grayish
centres of which might suggest miliary tubercle. The broncho-pneumonia,
however, has the whitish centres confined to the
bronchioles and their terminal air sacs, and represent their thickened
walls and muco-fibrinous contents; they do not show the
same tendency to caseation, nor necrosis of the tissue, nor to
caseation of the dependent lymph glands, and, above all, they do
not contain the bacillus tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>A noticeable feature in the tuberculous lung is the great frequency
of tubercles of all different ages from the initial transparent
nodule to the caseated or calcified mass side by side. A
tuberculous bronchitis is a familiar accompaniment, with lines of
miliary tubercles, ulcers and a flocculent (sometimes gritty)
muco-purulent discharge, containing elements of the necrotic
tissue and bacilli. Emphysema and interlobular œdema are also
met with.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>Pleuræ</i> often suffer by continuity of tissue from the
diseased lung, but they may be affected primarily through infection
of the circulating blood. The earliest pleural lesions may
be congestion, exudation and the formation of false membranes
in fringes, but soon these become the seats of minute nodules or
forming tubercles which steadily encrease to form pale red cauliflower-like
growths—which have been spoken of as <i>grapes</i>, from
their supposed resemblance to bunches of that fruit. Extensive
areas of the mediastinal, costal or pulmonic pleuræ are often
completely covered by these productions. Dense, and thick adhesions
sometimes form, holding in their substance characteristic
tubercles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>bronchial and mediastinal lymph glands</i> receiving as they
do the afferent trunks from the lungs and the great lymph sac of
the pleura, offer in their sluggish currents the most favorable culture
vessels, and almost always become affected in consequence.
Not unfrequently they are found to be tuberculous when the tissues
which they drain appear to be sound, and we must therefore,
conclude that the primary slight lesions in the latter have recovered,
or that the bacilli have passed through the tissues and
lymph channels without establishing any centre of disease. The
glandular lesions are primarily congestion and redness, with more
or less infiltration and swelling, followed by a nodular induration,
with enlargement or exceptionally shrinking. When bisected
they may show all stages of the tubercle from the miliary granule
to the caseous, dry, yellow, granular or cretaceous necrosis. By
aggregation these often grow to a large size, a long diameter
of 6 to 12 inches being not uncommon.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pericardial and Cardiac Lesions.</i> The pericardium may be
implicated from the pleuræ or independently, and though tuberculosis
of the heart is rare, it may be the seat of primary tuberculosis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>or of extension from the pericardium or endocardium. In
the N. Y. State Veterinary College Museum is a cow’s heart,
greatly enlarged, and completely invested and invaded by tubercle
several inches thick.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of the Mouth and Throat.</i> Tubercles sometimes
form in the <i>tongue</i> causing nodular swelling, with a caseated
centre. Much more frequently they attack the <i>pharynx</i> or <i>larynx</i>
with the formation of nodular necrotic swellings, followed by
ulcers and the implication of the adjacent lymph glands. The
glands are liable to be invaded through the tonsillar and other
follicles of the faucial and pharyngeal regions, which like the
solitary and agminated glands of the intestines form excellent
culture vessels. The glands most frequently attacked are the
<i>retro-pharyngeal</i>, but the <i>lateral pharyngeal</i>, the <i>intra-parotidean</i>
and <i>submaxillary</i> lymph glands occasionally suffer. They often
become indurated, yet the formation of abscess-like sacs is not
uncommon especially in the retro-pharyngeal.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Gastro-Intestinal</i>, <i>Peritoneal</i> and <i>Mesenteric Tubercles</i>. Tubercles
of the interior of the stomachs are rare, though they are
frequent on the peritoneal surface of the first three stomachs, as
rounded, subserous nodules varying in size from a pea upward.
The <i>mucosa of the small and large intestines</i> may suffer, by
preference in the seats of the solitary or agminated glands, and
the resulting ulcers may extend in the lines of the lymph vessels
from the convex to the attached border of the gut. The small
greenish caseated and calcified nodules on the intestines, which are
so often mistaken for tubercles, are the degenerated cysts of the
œsophagastoma. Tuberculosis of the mesenteric lymph glands
is much more common, the successive stages being essentially
like that seen in the bronchial glands. Beside these the surface
of the mesentery, omentum and abdominal parietes often becomes
the seat of congestion, exudation and cauliflower-like neoplasms
or grapes, as already stated of the pleuræ. In a certain number
caseation or cretefaction may be detected.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Liver Tuberculosis.</i> The liver is greatly exposed to tuberculosis
as the single destination of all the blood from the gastro-intestinal
tract. Tubercles also form on its surface by direct
infection from the peritoneum. The hepatic tubercles are often
very large and numerous, adding greatly to the bulk and weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>of the viscus. There is usually coincident tuberculosis of the
lymph glands of the porta.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tubercle of the Spleen.</i> This is also a favorite seat of the
morbid process, exposed as it is to the reflux of infected blood in
the portal vein, and to access of the bacillus from the peritoneum
and omental lymphatics.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>pancreas</i> is less exposed to the channels of the circulation
and is less frequently affected.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Genito-Urinary Tubercles.</i> The <i>kidneys</i> are always liable to
suffer in generalized tuberculosis, in accordance with their function
of elimination and the great quantity of blood that passes
through them. The tubercles may be numerous, encroaching
upon and destroying the glandular tissue, and determining congestion,
nephritis and hæmorrhage (Schütz). The <i>ovaries</i>,
when tuberculous, lead to nymphomania and sterility; they become
swollen, with rounded projections, indurated, and on section
show all stages of infiltration, caseation and calcification.
They may encrease to a great size. Tubercles are found on the
<i>Fallopian tubes</i>, the <i>serous and mucous surfaces of the womb</i>, and
in the <i>broad ligaments</i>, in all their characteristic forms. The
<i>bladder</i> and <i>vagina</i> are less frequently involved. In the male
the <i>testicle</i>, <i>epididymus</i>, <i>tunica vaginalis</i> and <i>prostate vesicles</i> are
sometimes affected. The swelling and induration of the affected
organ, or the existence of hydrocele, may be noted.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tubercle of the Udder.</i> From the mass of blood passed
through the udder it is specially exposed to infection whenever
the bacilli enter the circulation. It may also be directly infected
by the entrance through the teat, or a trauma, of the bacillus of
the stable dust. There may be for a time only a slight general
swelling which leads to no suspicion on the part of the milker,
and as the secretion is not arrested, a dangerous product may be
distributed. At this stage the lobules on section appear swollen,
gray, with paler or yellowish points and minute hæmorrhages.
The milk ducts contain coagula and bacilli (Bang). In other
cases, usually more advanced, the gland is hard, nodular, enlarged,
and shows a marked thickening of the walls of the smaller
milk ducts and secreting follicles, with yellowish and even caseous
and calcified centres. The gland is often greatly enlarged,
the milk suppressed or completely altered, and tubercular neoplasms
or ulcers exist in the larger ducts.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span><i>Tuberculosis of the Brain and Spinal Cord.</i> As noted in
Volume III. this occurs in young cattle especially in the form of
tubercles of all ages attached to the pia or arachnoid, on the brain,
or cerebellum, or in the ventricles, also in the cerebral matter, in
or on the lumbar enlargement of the cord or on its pia. Several
cases have come under my notice in the mature cow.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of the Eye.</i> This has been seen mainly as a result
of experimental inoculation, yet casual cases also occur in
the cornea, sclerotic, iris or choroid, the product undergoing early
necrosis and softening into a yellow mass filling the different
chambers.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of the Bones.</i> Though less frequent than that of
internal organs this is not rare. It usually attacks the spongy
tissue, near the articular extremities, or the vascular line between
epiphysis and diaphysis, giving rise to considerable exudate,
thickening of the bone and arthritis. The vertebræ, ribs,
sternum, petrous temporal, frontal and occipital also suffer. Sections
of the bone show dilatations of the cancelli, filled with the
characteristic nonvascular groups of giant, epithelioid and
lymphoid cells with, at times, softened and caseated centres.
The adjacent bone is congested and softened, so that the detachment
of epiphysis and apophyses is not uncommon. In case of
invasion of the joints the cartilages and ligaments are the seat of
tubercular deposits, softening, fibroid change and caseation, and
there is general synovitis. The cartilages of the ear (concha)
and nose (septum) may also be invaded.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tubercles of the Skin.</i> These are not very uncommon in cattle
being the counterpart of the tuberculous warts and ulcers of the
hands of butchers, tanners and others that handle the products of
diseased animals. They may show as little pea-like nodules in
the substance of the skin, or immediately beneath, very commonly
on the side of the abdomen, where their presence in life
furnishes a useful suggestion, as enlarged masses forming raw,
warty projections with centres of caseation, or as clusters of
warty-like growths of this kind (grapes).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of the Muscles.</i> This is comparatively rare in
cattle, though by no means unknown, appearing as tubercles of
the size of a pea and upward, in or between the muscular masses,
often showing a caseated centre.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span><i>Tubercle of Lymph Glands.</i> No organs in the body suffer
more than the lymph glands as they receive through their afferent
trunks and develop the bacilli coming from any adjacent tissue
to which they are subsidiary. There is also evidence to show
that bacilli entering from the lungs or bowels may pass through
these without apparent effect to develop in the connected lymph
glands. The frequent infection of the pharyngeal, bronchial,
mediastinal and mesenteric lymph glands has been already sufficiently
noticed, and if the other groups suffer less it is mainly
because the tissues from which they derive their lymph are less
frequently infected. An intimate knowledge of the different
groups of lymph glands is a most essential prerequisite to the
diagnosis of tuberculosis in life, and no less to a satisfactory <i>post
mortem</i> examination. The order of relative susceptibility and
importance is somewhat as follows: Bronchial, mediastinal,
mesenteric, hepatic, sublumbar, mammary inguinal, subdorsal,
phrenic, intercostal (especially the first and second), pharyngeal,
parotid, submaxillary, prescapular, prefemoral (stifle), prepectoral,
axillary, cubital and popliteal.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Relative Frequency of Tubercle in Different Parts in Cattle.</i>
The following table gives the seat of tubercle as noted by a number
of observers. It is open to the objection that it is the result
of examination for diagnosis, and therefore gives the most obvious
rather than the complete list of lesions. Examination of the
brain, bones, deep muscles and intermuscular glands, etc., was
usually omitted. Again, as the animals were often steers, the indications
as regards the generative organs are unreliable. The
œsophagostoma nodules on the bowels have been so often mistaken
for tubercles that I have omitted all reference to intestinal
tubercle.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span><i>Swine.</i> The <i>lesions</i> in swine, though essentially like those in
cattle, differ in some particulars. The primary tubercles are
more commonly pharyngeal or intestinal and mesenteric, in keeping
with infection by ingestion; caseation will often proceed to
liquefaction, so that the tubercles appear like grumous abscesses
with irregular outlines and vascular growths on their walls;
there is less tendency to cretefaction than in cattle; the muscular
and intermuscular tissues and the lymph glands are far more
frequently affected; ulceration of the pharyngeal and intestinal
mucosæ is more common. The lungs, liver, spleen and visceral
lymph glands are very subject to tubercle, the kidneys, uterus
and testicles somewhat less so, and the nerve centres least of all.
The serosæ are often involved and the seat of clusters of vascular
or caseated neoplasms (grapes). The bones and joints also
suffer, particularly in young growing animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Horse.</i> The horse suffers much less frequently than cattle or
swine, probably largely because of his outdoor life, his better
tone as the result of muscular work, and the absence of the excessive
milk secretion which is secured from cows and of the
dangers from ingestion that attend on swine. Yet, according to
Nocard, it is even more susceptible, and the disease once established
is liable to advance more rapidly to a diffuse generalization.
The <i>lesions</i> in the lungs and abdominal cavity resemble
those of cattle, both in nature and abundance; tuberculous polypi
and ulcers are more common; the visceral lymph glands (bronchial
and mesenteric) are early and severely attacked; the liver
and spleen suffer extensively, the serosæ somewhat less so;
lesions have been noted in the vertebræ, skin and muscles
(Cadiot). In rare instances tubercles have been seen in the
heart, and the aorta has been atheromatous (Cadiot). Necrotic
degeneration, caseation and cretefaction occur as in cattle.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sheep and Goat.</i> Tuberculosis is infrequent in the goat and
especially so in the sheep, owing perhaps largely to open air life and
their predilection for high, airy pastures. When inoculated they
show a marked susceptibility, and under favorable conditions they
contract the infection casually. The tubercles may be found in
all parts of the body,—lungs, thoracic lymph glands, intestines,
mesenteric and sublumbar glands liver, spleen, serosæ, lymph
glands at large, vertebræ, etc. There is less tendency to calcification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>than in the ox, the older tubercles remaining in the
caseated condition or bursting and forming vomicæ. A common
seat of casual tubercle in sheep is around the throat or on the
sides of the cranium or face.</p>

<p class='c008'>More frequently than in cattle, verminous affections (œsophagostoma
columbiana, and venulosum in the bowels, stongylus
filaria and rufescens in the lungs, linguatula denticula in the
mesenteric glands) are mistaken for tuberculosis, hence the necessity
for a careful investigation into the nature of the neoplasm,
the presence of the tubercle bacillus, and the absence of the worms
and their eggs. Except in the case of the linguatula the lymph
glands are little affected by the worms.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dog and Cat.</i> The <i>lesions</i> are often concentrated on the respiratory
or alimentary tract, but they have been noted also in the
pharyngeal glands, tonsils, posterior nares, serosæ, liver, pancreas,
spleen, nerve centres, ovary, uterus, testicle, epididymus,
tunica vaginalis, prostate, heart, aorta, bones and joints. They
follow the regular development of bovine tubercle, and caseation
and cretefaction are prominent features. These animals are especially
liable to infection by eating the left victuals from the plate of
a consumptive owner, as well as by devouring consumptive prey,
and the primary lesions are to be looked for along the line of the
throat, bowels, liver and lungs. For the dog Cadiot records
caseating polypi and ulcers on the mucosa of the larynx, trachea
and bronchia, and Müller and Cadiot several cases of pharyngeal
caseating adenitis in the <i>dog</i> bursting externally and developing
intractable fistulæ, having abundance of bacilli in the discharge.
These he attributes to expectorated virus from old standing
tubercles in the chest infecting the pharyngeal mucosa and indirectly
the lymph glands. The infection entering with the food
and lodging in the follicles of the tonsils would act in the same
way, and infected wounds received in fighting must also be
quoted. <i>Cats</i> suffer from similar intractable sores, some of
which may be traced to a tuberculous origin. The lungs are
often extensively hepatized and of a general pale grayish color,
but the early miliary lesions, the caseating and cutaneous centres,
the vomicæ often intercommunicating, the tuberculous bronchial
and mediastinal glands and the bacilli show the true nature. Intestinal
ulcers are common, especially on the agminated glands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>and small tubercles, in all stages of degeneration are met with in
the enlarged liver, the spleen, pancreas, kidney, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Apes and Menagerie Animals.</i> In these tuberculosis is common
alike in the thoracic and abdominal forms, and the lesions in
the main are those of domestic cattle.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Chickens.</i> The <i>lesions</i> are common in the abdominal cavity,
the intestines, liver and spleen being the most frequently attacked,
while the subcutaneous connective tissue, bones and joints also
suffer. The lungs and kidneys usually escape. The intestinal
mucosa shows small nodules, often caseated, or ulcers; the
enlarged and friable liver is studded with tubercles from the size
of a hemp seed upward, gray or translucid, homogeneous or with
central necrosis, simply or in conglomerate masses, with congested
or hæmorrhagic periphery; the spleen is swollen and permeated
by similar deposits; fibrinous ascitis is not uncommon; the
abdominal lymph glands are enlarged and congested.</p>

<p class='c008'>The early tubercle shows a central, necrotic, hyaline area, consisting
of the debris of disintegrated cells, which is colored brown
by picro carmine, unlike the nucleus of the pheasant tubercle
(Cadiot). Around the hyaline centre is a zone of large epithelioid
cells, the nuclei of which stain strongly in carmine. Outside
this is the usual zone of small, round, lymphoid cells. In
the whole the tubercle bacilli can be made manifest by the carbol-fuchsin
(Ziehl-Neelsen) stain. In the older and larger tubercles
the central necrotic mass has encroached in part or in whole on
the epithelio-lymphoid zone.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pheasant.</i> The <i>lesions</i> have the same seats and naked-eye
aspect as the chicken tubercle, but under the microscope the
smallest and most recent tubercles show epithelioid cells to the
centre, or later, the central zone presents a dense fibrous network
enclosing open spaces and giving a mahogany stain with Lugol’s
solution (iodine and potassium iodide). (Cadiot). There has
been an organisation of connective tissue which has submitted to
amyloid degeneration, making a clear distinction from the tubercle
of chicken.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Parrot.</i> The <i>lesions</i> were thus located by Eberlein and Cadiot:</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>skin lesions</i> are vascular neoplasms containing bacilli and
usually invested with a covering of horn, but sometimes, on the
legs and feet raw. The morbid growth may be rounded or conical,
narrowing to a point. The <i>lesions of the buccal mucosa</i>
begin as small, grayish swellings on the angle of the mouth,
palate, tongue or larynx which grow out into more or less
rounded vegetations. The <i>lesions of the liver and lungs</i> are
mostly miliary with the usual tubercular features, but they may
grow to larger size, as a pea or bean. In the <i>cancelli of bones</i> and
on their surface, the lesions resemble those of the mammal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cutaneous form has been held to be the counterpart of
warty lupus of man, the more plausibly that the disease is developed
by inoculation from tuberculous men. The arthritic
type represents what is described as gout in parrots.</p>

<p class='c008'>In any case the recent miliary lesion presents the true tubercular
type of a central giant cell or cells with bacilli, surrounded
by epithelioid cells, and they in turn by small, rounded lymphoid
globules.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INFECTION.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The estimate of the relative, early or late infection of two organs
or tissues may often be made with reasonable accuracy
from the fact that the lesions in one organ are old, caseated, calcified
or sclerosed, while those in the other organ are all recent,
with vascular environment and almost devoid of caseation or
other degenerative process. We cannot safely predicate our decision
on the greater number of old lesions in one organ rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>than another, as the disease may have advanced much more
rapidly in the one tissue. Still less can we state with certainty
that the disease has not entered by a given channel because no
lesions are left to show the transit of the bacillus along its supposed
course. We frequently find tuberculosis of the bronchial
or mesenteric glands, when we can detect no lesion in the lung,
nor intestine. The bacillus has been passed on without establishing
any lasting lesion in transit.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is often too confidently asserted that the infected dust inhaled,
falls directly on the air cells and determines the extensive
pulmonary tuberculosis that ensues. So, on the other hand, it
is often too arrogantly assumed that tubercle bacilli ingested with
food, must necessarily show their results mainly in the intestines,
mesenteric glands and liver. That solid particles can find their
way directly into the lungs, has long been demonstrated by the
pulmonary anthracosis of the miner, and the deadly phthisis of
the stone hewer and cutler. The experiments of Cornet, Tappeiner
and others in producing pulmonary tuberculosis, by compelling
the inhalation of infected spray, corroborate this experience
very satisfactorily. Yet it does not follow that all of the
offensive matter penetrated the air cells at once on the air inhaled.
The heavy particles of steel, quartz and even of coal
dust must be mainly arrested on the surface of the moist air passages,
yet, under the irritation caused by their presence and the
consequent arrest of the ciliary motion, they would slowly gravitate
downward to the pulmonary cells. In the case of the inspired
tubercular spray or dust, we must recognize the possibility
of the approach of the bacillus to the lungs through the lymph
and blood channels as well. The bacilli lodged in the pharynx,
and, above all, in the tonsillar follicles, can readily enter the
lymph vessels, and are finally poured into the lower end of the
jugular vein, but a few inches from the right heart, by which
they are instantly propelled into the lungs. If then the lung is
the most receptive and least resistant organ, it may easily be that
this is the first point where the bacillus can establish a strong
and effective colony. Apart from this the colonization of the
tonsillar follicles may determine a constant supply of fresh bacilli,
which may gravitate down with the abundant mucus toward
the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>This tuberculous colonization of the tonsillar follicles is doubtless
the main source of the infection of the pharyngeal lymph
glands, which is so common in ox, pig and dog. It tends
further to intestinal tuberculosis through the frequent swallowing
of the products of the infected follicles. Then the infection of
the pharynx and tonsils, whether established by inhalation or
deglutition, may be the first step toward a secondary infection of
the intestines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the bowels can be infected by the frequent swallowing
of the expectorations brought up from the diseased lungs or
bronchia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Conversely the lungs may be easily infected secondarily from
preëxisting disease of the abdominal organs, and again primarily
through the lymph channels. With tuberculosis of the cardia or
liver the bacilli can follow the lymph vessels of the œsophagus or
vena cava so as to reach the mediastinal glands, and from these
glands in a state of disease they can easily pass into the adjacent
pleural cavity and reach the lung. Or by following the mesenteric
lymphatics they reach the thoracic duct and enjoy what is
virtually for them a culture fluid, until discharged into the jugular,
which, as already stated, is but a few inches from the right
heart and lung.</p>

<p class='c008'>Extension through the general blood stream usually takes
place only when tubercles have already become numerous and
extensive in a given region of the body, and its occurrence is the
signal for a generalized tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>The extension from the gastro-intestinal organs, pancreas and
spleen may be considered as a partial exception. Here the infecting
blood is not the general blood stream, but has to run the
gauntlet of the liver capillaries by which the bacilli may be sifted
out and delayed. This arrest subjects the liver to secondary
tuberculosis in almost all cases of abdominal tuberculosis, and
goes far to explain the extraordinary frequency of the disease in
this organ. Ingestion tuberculosis almost necessarily leads to
hepatic tuberculosis, and this notwithstanding that the primary
lesion may have been very circumscribed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tuberculization of such a large vascular organ as the liver,
however, paves the way for further extension, and if once extensively
diseased, the early generalization of the infection is to be
dreaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tuberculosis may be acute or chronic, yet as seen in cattle,
from casual infection, it usually comes on very slowly and insidiously
and follows a chronic course. As the symptoms vary
according to the organs involved it will be convenient to consider
these in turn beginning with such as show the most diagnostic
phenomena.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pulmonary Tuberculosis.</i> Though one of the most common
and dangerous forms of the disease this may last for months or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>years without any suspicion on the part of the owner or caretaker
of anything amiss. There may be an occasional cough, short,
weak, dry, wheezing, perhaps repeated and roused by opening
the stable door in cold weather, by leaving the stable for the cold
outer air, by rising suddenly in the stall, by being driven on a
run for a short distance, by drinking cold water or by eating dusty
food. If driven for some distance, or put to draught work (ox)
the subject blows more than the others. Sometimes even at rest,
breathing is slightly accelerated. Yet the spirits may be as good,
the eye as clear and full, the coat as smooth and sleek and the
skin as soft and mellow as in health. Some such animals give as
much milk, of as rich a quality, or, when put up to fatten, lay on
flesh apparently as well as their healthy fellows. In favorable
cases percussion may elicit circumscribed areas of dulness,
and wincing or other sign of tenderness, and auscultation may
detect crepitation or wheezing over the same points. By covering
the nose and mouth with a sac or blanket the breathing is rendered
more labored and the morbid sounds become clearer and
more definite. The use of a stethoscope or phonendoscope may
also render them more distinct. The morbid râles are more significant
of tuberculosis if found in a number of isolated and circumscribed
spots, with healthy respiratory murmur between, than
if simply surrounding a single extended area of flatness as is usual
in pneumonia. Much, however, stands in the way of success at
this early stage. The heavy muscular and bony mass of the
shoulder covers the anterior lobe and partially muffles the auscultation
sound, while it renders percussion useless. The thick
covering of the ribs in fat animals proves a serious barrier to successful
auscultation and percussion. The varying plenitude of
the abdominal viscera, and the rumbling, trickling, gurgling, and
in the case of the rumen the crepitation of the contents, tend to
complicate, obscure or cover up the pulmonary sounds. There
is usually no appreciable elevation of temperature, or a slight
rise of about one degree takes place at distant and uncertain
intervals so as to render it useless for purposes of diagnosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease is more advanced and the pulmonary lesions
more extensive, the animals usually appear less thrifty on the
same feeding, yet fat animals are habitually killed for food that
show quite extensive pulmonary tuberculosis. With loss of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>condition, the coat loses its lustre somewhat, the hair becomes
dry and stares in patches, and the skin loses its mobility and
mellowness. The cough may be more frequent, perhaps paroxysmal
under excitement, harsher, more short and broken, and either
dry and husky or moist and gurgling, with a succeeding deep inspiration
perhaps a moist râle. When the skin on the last ribs
is pinched up between the fingers and thumb it is slower in flattening
down to its normal smoothness, pinching of the spine at
the shoulder or back, or it may be of the sternum, may cause
wincing and even moaning, and the same may come of percussing
the ribs smartly with the closed fist. There is now more decided
evidence of flatness on percussion on the various affected points,
and of abolition or lessening of the respiratory murmur, which
is replaced by wheezing, or by bronchial blowing sound, heart
beats and abdominal crepitation or gurgling, conveyed to the ear
more clearly through the intervening consolidated tissue. The
breathing may be slightly accelerated even at rest, and becomes
distinctly so on exertion. The appetite fails somewhat and the
secretion of milk lessens, or it may become more pale and watery.
Chronic tympany occurring after meals occasionally appears,
usually indicating tuberculosis of the glands along the œsophagus
with pressure on that organ impairing eructation, and on the
vagus nerve so as to impair nervous control. In connection with
this there come on signs of generalization of the tubercle, as
irregularity of the bowels, or enlargement or nodular induration
of some of the superficial lymph glands, as the pharyngeal, prescapular,
prepectoral, axillary, prefemoral, inguinal or mammary.
Expectoration is usually abundant but it is difficult to
secure it for diagnostic purposes since the moment it reaches the
pharynx it is instantly swallowed, while any that may have been
projected into the anterior nares is licked out by the pointed
tongue. Nocard tried to secure this through a cannula passed in
between the tracheal rings but with very little success. Others
have introduced the hand into the pharynx, rousing the cough by
tickling the larynx, and attempting to bring out the expectoration
in the hand. When it can be secured its solid and opaque
flocculi may be stained and examined for the bacillus, or it may
be inoculated on a Guinea pig, intraperitoneally, to test its virulence.
If there are open vomicæ or complex infection the breath
is usually heavy and mawkish.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>In the most advanced stages the symptoms are very characteristic.
The subject is miserably thin and wastes visibly from
day to day, the hair is dry and erect, most marked along the
spine, the skin is scurfy, rigid, lousy, and clings firmly to the
bones, the eyes are pale, deeply sunken in their sockets and
bleary, the tears running over the cheeks, while a yellowish,
granular, fœtid, and often gritty discharge flows from the nose,
and dries in masses around the alæ. The cough is weak, painful,
paroxysmal, and easily roused by pinching the back or breast or
percussing the ribs. The breathing is liable to be hurried, even
panting, and the animal may stand most of its time with nose extended
to obviate the oppression that comes of recumbency. All
the visible mucosæ are pale and blanched, and the pulse weak
and rapid with every indication of anæmia. The temperature is
usually raised to 104° or 105° F. and the milk secretion is completely
arrested. Indications of generalized tuberculosis become
more marked in the enlarged glands, diarrhœa, and clouded
(purulent), or blood stained urine with microscopic casts, and
even anasarca. The morbid sounds in the lungs have become a
complex variety according to the nature of the lesion, blowing,
wheezing, amphoric, friction, creaking, mucous, with the other
bruits conveyed from adjacent organs. Death usually occurs in
a state of complete marasmus, after months or years of illness.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of the Abdomen.</i> This usually affects the intestines,
mesenteric glands, peritoneum, liver, spleen and pancreas,
and has been known as <i>tabes mesenterica</i>. The generative organs
also occasionally suffer, in which case, an early and rather persistent
symptom is sterility, with a too frequent or it may be persistent
desire for the bull (nymphomania). There is usually a
steady loss of condition in spite of good feeding, the impaired
functions of the intestinal mucosa, but especially of the mesenteric
glands, liver and pancreas, interfering seriously with absorption
and assimilation. The victims are therefore known as piners.
While there may be more or less fever, highest in the evening,
this is by no means marked, and cough and respiratory trouble
may be entirely absent. Indications are not lacking, however,
of digestive trouble. Slight tympany may follow meals, and the
bowels are irregular, costiveness alternating with diarrhœa. If
heavy feeding is resorted to, diarrhœa is the usual result, accompanied,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>it may be, by colic and tympany. There is a tendency
to formation of pea or nut-like nodes under the skin of the flank,
and Kleinpaul claims that the tubercles or vegetations on the
rumen can be felt by manipulation of the left flank. Clearer
evidence can often be had by rectal exploration, the tubercles
and enlarged glands being felt on the rumen, in the knotted
mesentery and in the sublumbar and subsacral region.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of <i>uterine tuberculosis</i>, the nymphomania may be supplemented
by a purulent discharge, and rectal exploration may
detect the tubercles on its surface, in the broad ligaments or even
in the enlarged ovaries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Great fœtor of the fæces may indicate ulceration of the mucosa,
indigestion or impaired hepatic function.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a great length of time the disease may be virtually confined
to the mesenteric or portal glands, or even to the spleen,
while the animal enjoys fairly good health. Again, in some instances,
the subject may be fat and sleek, though the rumen,
omentum or mesentery is to a large extent literally covered with
tuberculous vegetations. The tuberculization of the intestines,
mesenteric glands, liver or pancreas interferes far more with the
general health than does even extensive peritoneal tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the case advances it tends to generalization and winds up
with the general symptoms predicated above of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Genital Tuberculosis</i> in the bull is associated with nodular
swelling of the testicle, epididymus or cord, hydrocele, and exceptionally
tubercle on the penis, or in the prostatic sac.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mammary Tuberculosis.</i> This may be primary and circumscribed
under direct infection through a trauma or by the milk
ducts, but more commonly it is secondary to generalized tuberculosis.
It may be a rather firm, uniform, painless swelling of one
or two quarters (usually hind ones) without at first serious interference
with milk secretion. As the disease advances, the follicles
and ducts being invaded, an irregular knotted condition is developed,
the milk becomes pale, watery, semi-coagulated and
filled with bacilli, and the climax is reached in a densely indurated
condition of the gland. From the first the mammary lymph
glands, behind and it may be in front of the organ, become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>swollen, and they are finally indurated as caseation or calcification
ensues. The superficial inguinal glands often participate.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pharyngeal Tuberculosis.</i> In this rather common localisation
the retro-pharyngeal glands and those on the side of the pharynx
especially suffer, though the parotidean lymphatic gland and the
submaxillary often participate. Enlargement and induration of
the tonsils and ulceration of the mucosa may be present. There is
distinct swelling of the throat or displacement downward of the
larynx, and the enlarged or hard nodular, perhaps even shrunken,
glands may often be detected by manipulation. The nose is carried
slightly protruded and a stertor or wheeze accompanies the
breathing. A glairy liquid may run from the mouth or nose,
and in this, bacilli may often be detected under the microscope.
The retro-pharyngeal glands are very subject to softening and
liquefaction, and in such a case an obscurely fluctuating swelling
may be detected above the pharynx when the hand is introduced
through the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>This usually terminates in generalized tuberculosis, though it
will often remain for a length of time the one appreciable localization.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cutaneous Tuberculosis.</i> The counterpart of <i>tuberculosis verrucosa</i>
of man, this probably usually occurs by direct inoculation in
a sore, yet the infection may reach the seat of lesion through the
blood. It is usually represented by an irregular clustering warty
growth, hanging more or less loosely from the skin and showing
at points caseating centres. Bacilli may be recognized under the
microscope.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Glandular Tuberculosis.</i> Aside from the tuberculosis of the internal
lymph glands already referred to, tubercles may form in
any group of lymph glands, causing swelling, induration, fibroid
degeneration or tuberculous abscess. Among these may be
named the glands in front of the stifle or shoulder, at the root of
the ear, beneath the zigoma, in the jugular furrow, the prepectoral,
axillary, inguinal, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of the Brain and Meninges.</i> Disorder of the cerebral
functions occurring in generalized tuberculosis may be held
to point to this disease. The earlier meningeal symptoms are
often those of excitability, timidity, spasms, visual troubles, etc.,
merging later into vertigo, hebetude, paresis, unsteady gait, local
paralysis and coma.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span><i>Tuberculosis of the Eye.</i> This has been seen mostly as the result
of experimental inoculation, with conjunctival and sclerotic
congestion, corneal opacity, and the development of yellowish
centres in the iris and choroid, from which the tubercle extends
into the chambers.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of the Heart, Pericardium or Pleura.</i> Tuberculosis
of the pleura is usually a concomitant of pulmonary phthisis,
yet it may exist for a time independently, and its diagnosis presents
serious difficulties. There may be tenderness of the intercostal
spaces, a friction sound in case of raw granular surface or
vegetations, creaking from false membranes or even flatness
low down on percussion. If these escape notice, a short painful
cough and slightly hurried breathing under exertion, in the absence
of objective symptoms of lung disease, may lead to suspicion,
but the true nature of the affection must remain in suspense.
It usually leads to pulmonary or glandular (bronchial), and
finally generalized tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pericardial or Cardiac Tuberculosis</i> is usually secondary and
may be suspected when friction is synchronous with the heart
sounds, when the heart beats or sounds are irregular or intermittent,
or when the area of cardiac dulness is greatly encreased.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of Bones and Joints.</i> This is more common in
calves and growing cattle, but may be present at any age. As
affecting the vertebræ it causes stiffness and unsteady gait, perhaps
what was looked on as a simple sprain causes persistent
lameness in spite of treatment, and a point or area of tenderness
on pinching is manifest. In the large bones and joints of the
limbs, the cancellated extremities, or it may be a simple process
with its inserted tendon or ligament, shows a firm, persistent
swelling, and there is acute synovitis of the joint. In acute cases
in calves the epiphysis may become detached from the diaphysis so
as to make the limb useless. In the mature animal the enlargement
and lameness may last for years without material change.
The condition may be difficult to diagnose, in the absence of signs
of tuberculosis elsewhere in the body, or unless the synovia, withdrawn
through a sterilized nozzle, with antiseptic precautions,
should show the presence of bacilli.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>SYMPTOMS OF TUBERCULOSIS IN SWINE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In young pigs, infected by the milk of the dam, there are general
unthriftiness, stunted growth, emaciation and unhealthy
skin, encrusted with a dark unctuous matter or scurf, as in chronic
hog cholera. Temperature is variable on successive days, or
times of the same day. Digestive disorder is manifested by slight
colics, diarrhœa, vomiting, tympany and abdominal tenderness.
The pig becomes pot bellied, with hollowness of the flanks in
front of the iliac bones, and manipulation may detect the tuberculous
bowels and mesentery in the form of a knotted mass.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roloff describes a caseous colitis with ulceration of the mucosa,
which is probably tuberculous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Enlargement of the superficial lymph glands (pharyngeal, inguinal,
prescapular) may be present. Traumatic infection of the
castration sore and inguinal glands has been noted. As the disease
becomes generalized, implicating the lungs, there is a dry
paroxysmal cough and hurried breathing, becoming more oppressed
on the slightest exertion. If quiet and thin enough for
auscultation and percussion the usual morbid lung sounds can be
heard. Unlike cattle, pigs are very subject to muscular and intermuscular
tubercles, and as there is a general tendency to caseation,
these are usually to be found as saccular cavities with soft,
sometimes liquid, caseated contents. The bones and joints may
suffer, as in cattle. The tonsils are usually enlarged and even
caseous. The outer auditory meatus and the interior of the eye
have been found affected. Cases affecting the brain were manifested
by nervous disorder, rearing up on the fence, turning in
a circle, spasms, rolling of the eyes, paresis and paralysis, often
hemiplegic. When one or other of these indications of local disease
is found associated with the general disorder of the lungs or
bowels, in a herd fed on raw meat scraps, milk, or the soiled
food of tuberculous animals, the evidence is strongly in favor of
the local tubercle corresponding to the symptoms. It is noticeable
that diagnosis by microscopic examination is difficult and
uncertain because of the relatively very small number of the
bacilli. In the mature pig the disease may be difficult of diagnosis
without tuberculin, and a <i>post mortem</i> examination may be
necessary to identify the disease in the herd.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>SYMPTOMS OF TUBERCULOSIS IN THE HORSE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Though not a common disease in the horse yet a large number
of cases are on record, and accidental and experimental cases
alike show that this animal is peculiarly receptive to the disease.
The early symptoms depend on the location of the primary lesions,
yet the general phenomena of debility, languor, early fatigue,
unfitness for violent efforts, perspiration on slight exertion, irregular
appetite, occasional rises of temperature and emaciation may
usually be noted. The advance is usually slow, almost imperceptible,
with periods of improvement and aggravation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some cases have appeared in the submaxillary and pharyngeal
lymph glands with sore throat and were for a time mistaken for
glanders (Ehrhardt, McFadyean). Others show a swelling of
the appearance of cold abscess in the seat of the prepectoral
glands (Johne, Röbert). One showed widely distributed lymph
nodes and enlarged and indurated lymph glands (prepectoral,
inguinal, etc.) with thickening of the intervening lymph
vessels (Cadiot). This last suffered from bronchitis two months
before. A number of cases reported by McFadyean showed
special stiffness of the neck, with swelling and distortion of the
vertebral joints, due to a tubercular osteitis and periostitis, and
associated as necropsy showed with internal tuberculosis. Cases
of this kind occurred in the practice of McConnell, Dawes, Insall,
Malcolm and Hill, so that tuberculosis may well be suspected in
cases of disease of the cervical vertebræ. In all of these cases
post mortem examination, performed at once, or after a long
delay, showed generalized internal tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the chest is extensively affected, the symptoms are those
of broncho-pneumonia or heaves (broken wind), there is hurried
breathing with paroxysmal cough sometimes dry and wheezy, at
others moist or mucous, a double lift of the flank in expiration,
and a muco-purulent discharge from the nose, sometimes streaked
with blood. Auscultation detects a varying force of the respiratory
murmur at different points, with more or less wheezing.
Blowing and other sounds conveyed to the ear through the solidified
lung tissues are more rare or less marked. Percussion may
show general resonance, encreased at emphysematous points, and
diminished in small circumscribed areas, the seats of tubercle or
consolidation. There are of course the attendant debility, inappetence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>fever and steadily advancing emaciation. In some cases
the enlarged tracheo-bronchial glands are seen to bulge forward
between the two first ribs, and by the sides of the trachea. Stocking
of the limbs is frequent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abdominal tuberculosis is most common in the young foal and
when not secondary, may be due to feeding on tuberculous milk,
especially in those brought up by hand on cow’s milk. There is
debility, emaciation, anæmia, irregular appetite, digestive disorder,
constipation alternating with diarrhœa, colics, pot-belly, falling
in beneath the lumbar transverse processes, dry, harsh, scurfy
skin and advancing marasmus. Rectal exploration will usually
detect the enlarged sublumbar and mesenteric glands, and the
simultaneous manifestations of disease of the lungs, superficial
lymph glands, throat, or bones serve to identify the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the advanced stages of tuberculosis in solipeds polyuria is a
frequent phenomenon (Nocard) tending to hasten the general
anæmia and marasmus.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient often works for months or years but with gradually
encreasing debility, which is soon fatal after the occurrence of
generalized tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>In estimating the nature of the disease, indications may often
be drawn from the environment, feeding, etc. Nocard as the result
of a careful study of the morphology and habits of the bacilli
has shown that the more purely abdominal form of equine tuberculosis
is near akin to that of the chicken, while the pronouncedly
pulmonary form resembles the human type. McFadyean on his
part adduces a number of cases of tuberculosis in horses that
had been fed largely on cows’ milk, a most significant fact considering
that such a ration is rare for this animal, and that few
horses contract tuberculosis casually. Exposure therefore to the
sputa of man, of the nasal or bowel products of birds or to the
milk of cows, may suggest the probability of tuberculosis in a
horse with chronic anæmia, debility and wasting.</p>

<p class='c008'>The discharges from the nose of the affected horse are more
available than those of cattle for examination and experimental
inoculation, yet in many occult cases the diagnosis by tuberculin
is the only reliable resort.</p>

  <h3 class='c009'>SYMPTOMS OF TUBERCULOSIS IN SHEEP AND GOATS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The tubercles have been usually found post mortem in these
animals or as the result of experimental inoculation, and symptoms
have not been well recorded. They follow the same order
as in the ox, weak husky cough, wheezing and other râles in the
lungs, disorders of the digestive organs, swollen lymph nodes
and glands, and caseated products in those that were of some
standing. I have found these latter especially, in the region of
the throat in high bred rams kept in confined buildings or yards
and highly fed to prepare for <i>letting</i> or sale. These lose in vigor
and activity and <i>scrofulous</i> swellings form on the neck, head or
elsewhere and become rapidly caseated. In German abattoirs
tuberculous sheep proved 0.1 to 0.15 per cent. In Saxon goats
the percentage was 0.6.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SYMPTOMS OF TUBERCULOSIS IN DOGS AND CATS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>These follow in the main those of consumptive cattle. As the
infection generally enters with food, the early symptoms often
point to disease of the throat and alimentary tract, while the later
ones involve those of the respiratory organs as well. Impaired
and capricious appetite, debility, early exhaustion under exertion,
emaciation, sunken pallid eyes, apathetic expression of the face,
lack of life and gaiety, a knotted feeling of the abdomen if the
region is flaccid, and a tense fluctuating sensation if ascitic, with
usually enlargement of the superficial lymph glands are noticeable.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the chest becomes affected there is the hurried breathing,
quickly encreased by exertion, panting, paroxysmal cough,
wheezing, and the various morbid râles in the chest, crepitant,
friction, creaking, blowing, cavernous, mucous, etc. On percussion,
flatness is detected in limited areas in a number of centres.
Expectoration is usually promptly swallowed and can only be
secured with difficulty for examination.</p>

<p class='c008'>When tuberculous sores and fistulæ occur in the region of the
throat or elsewhere, the evidence is patent and the bacilli can
easily be found in the discharges.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>cats</i> the course and symptoms do not materially differ. In
both animals the history usually shows the connection of house
life and the habit of eating after tuberculous persons.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>SYMPTOMS OF TUBERCULOSIS IN BIRDS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In the gallinaceæ there may be inappetence, vomiting, diarrhœa,
with hurried breathing, sneezing, and the general phenomena of
debility, weakness, advancing emaciation and anæmia, the comb
and wattles becoming pale and flaccid and the visible mucosæ
bloodless. The eyes are sunken and lack lustre, the head sinks,
the wings and tail droop, and weight is steadily lost. When the
bones and joints of the legs and wings are involved the local
swellings and distortions are visible indications of the trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>parrots</i> these local swellings and particularly the horn-covered
vegetations on the face and around the beak are characteristic.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Canary.</i> Tuberculosis is common in the canary, contracted,
as in the parrot, from man, with whom alone the caged bird
comes into dangerous contact. The interchange of the disease
between pet birds and their owners would demand the exclusion
of such from the rooms of consumptives, and a careful watch for
indications of disease of the air passages with marasmus, that the
bird may be disposed of before it has become a source of danger.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>DIAGNOSIS OF TUBERCULOSIS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>It is needless to repeat the various symptoms of tuberculosis according
to its different seats and the degree of its extension in the
animal body. In cases in which the indications are slight,
greater importance may be given to them through the knowledge
of the existence of more advanced or decided cases in the same
herd, or the necropsies of animals taken from it. Yet in the
average herd it is safely within bounds to say that three fourths
of the affected cattle will escape condemnation if we employ objective
symptoms alone. In one herd of seventy head, in which
the tuberculin test condemned twenty-four head (being 50 per
cent. of the mature animals), I left the examination after
slaughter to the veterinarian of the A. J. C. C. who was at the
time skeptical as to the value of the tuberculin test. He wrote
me afterward of his surprise at finding every one of the twenty-four
condemned animals tuberculous, when not one of them had
shown symptoms by which he could recognize the disease in life.
This is no exceptional case, and may be advanced rather as a
typical example of the ordinary infected country herd.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span><i>Microscopic</i> detection of the bacillus in the expectoration may
be successful in the horse with pharyngeal or pulmonary tuberculosis,
but fails in those forms that affect the other internal
organs. It is all but useless for the expectoration of cattle and
dogs. When there is cutaneous tuberculosis or a tuberculous
fistula this is much more valuable, and it is especially useful in
dogs and parrots.</p>

<p class='c008'>The precipitate in the centrifuge will often show the bacilli
that are present in milk, but in very many cases of tuberculosis
the bacilli are not present in the milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>The centrifuge used on the <i>urine</i> may also succeed when kidneys,
bladder or prostate are affected, but the bacilli are rarely
found in the absence of disease of these organs. The smegma
bacillus is a source of fallacy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The serous effusions in the affected <i>serosæ</i> (pleura, peritoneum,
pericardium, synovial cavities) may also be centrifuged and the
presence of the bacilli revealed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>agglutination test</i> of Arloing and Courmont though often
giving positive results, (95.5 per cent. in pulmonary tuberculosis,
50 per cent. in surgical, Arloing and Courmont; 40 per cent.,
Knopf; 25 to 50 per cent., Lartigan); yet proved too unreliable,
and frequently gave positive results when tuberculosis was absent.
The best medium for cultures to be so used is 6 per cent. glycerine
bouillon, and the age of the tuberculosis culture 8 to 12
days. One part of fresh blood serum of the suspected animal in
a sterilized capillary tube is added to ten parts of the bacillus culture,
and the tube placed in an oblique position. In 2 to 24
hours a fine sand-like material precipitates along the sides of the
tube, and the microscope shows the bacilli in clumps, absolutely
still without even Brownian movements. Gallemaerts found that
it proved very satisfactory with the serum of Guinea pigs after
three days from intraperitoneal inoculation, was less marked
after inoculations subcutem, and that in man the agglutination
appeared in influenza and pneumonia in the entire absence of
tuberculosis. Such an uncertain test cannot be utilized in veterinary
sanitary work.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Experimental inoculation</i> with milk, expectoration, morbid discharges,
the scraping of nodules, etc., is much more searching,
and will detect more cases than the microscopic examination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>But it fails entirely in cases in which the milk of unquestionably
tuberculous animals is free from bacilli, or in which the local
nodule or discharge tested is itself free from tubercle. It is a
test of the local lesion and not of the entire animal system.</p>

<p class='c008'>In choosing a subject for inoculation, the first consideration is
that it must come from a healthy stock and be itself free from
tuberculosis. Next, it must be of a species actively susceptible
to the habitual tuberculosis of the animal from which the inoculated
matter is taken. Thus for man, ox, dog and parrot, the
Guinea pig is especially appropriate, while for gallinaceæ and
horses, the rabbit is to be preferred. Inoculation is usually made
into the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a period of two or three weeks is usually necessary to
allow of an extensive development of tuberculosis, the method
must be too often discarded on account of the delay in obtaining
results.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculin test.</i> Many stock owners still entertain an ignorant
and unwarranted dread of the tuberculin test. It is quite true
that, when recklessly used by ignorant or careless people it may
be made a root of evil, yet as employed by the intelligent and
careful expert it is not only perfectly safe, but it is the only
known means of ascertaining approximately the actual number
affected in a given herd. In most infected herds, living under
what are in other respects, good hygienic conditions, ⅔ or ¾ are
not to be detected without its aid, so that in clearing a herd from
tuberculosis and placing both herd and products above suspicion
the test becomes essential.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculin</i> is the bouillon in which the tubercle bacillus has
been grown, charged with the toxic products of its growth, but
which has been raised to a boiling temperature to destroy all
germ life, and from which the dead germs have been removed by
passing it through a porcelain filter. When a physiological dose
of this has been injected, subcutem, into the suspected animal,
it has no effect on the non-tuberculous, while in the tuberculous
it produces, in the course of the next 24 hours (usually from the
8th to the 16th), a steady rise of temperature by 2° F. or more,
followed by a slow subsidence to the normal. This may last for
from three to ten hours in different cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the precautions may be named:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>1. The temperature of the animal is best taken at intervals, or
at least, morning, noon and night, on the day preceding the injection
to see that the animal shows no habitual rise at any time
of the day. Yet in busy field work the one night temperature
taken just before injecting will rarely fail to give a satisfactory
normal as a standard for the animal. Any quotidian rise almost
invariably reaches its climax at night.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. <i>The subject must be in good general health.</i> If there is
present in the system any concurrent disease it may undergo an
aggravation within twenty-four hours and give a rise of temperature
that will be mistakenly set down for tuberculosis. At the
very start, therefore, it is important that the general health of
the subject should be first assured by a critical professional examination.
If some other disease is present the tuberculin test
had best, as a rule, be delayed until that has subsided, while if
tuberculosis is found the test will be superfluous.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. <i>The subject must not be within three weeks of parturition, nor
about to abort.</i> In many cases, though not in all, as preparations
are made for calving, the system becomes unduly susceptible to
the presence of tuberculin and that agent will cause a rise of
temperature, though no tuberculosis is present. Unless this
source of error is carefully guarded against the most valuable
cows in the herd may be condemned unjustly.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. <i>The cow must not be within three days of the period at which
“heat” would naturally occur.</i> Under the excitement of œstrum
the body temperature usually rises two or three degrees, and if
tuberculin has been used this rise may be attributed to tuberculosis
and a sound animal may be condemned. Nor is it always
enough that the animal is supposed to be pregnant. Abortions
sometimes take place unexpectedly and unknown to the owner.
If, therefore, a cow under the test and which is not well advanced
in pregnancy should show a rise of temperature it should be at
once ascertained whether the animal is not in “heat.” If symptoms
of “heat” are found she should be set aside along with any
calving cows to be tested again when such a source of error is no
longer present.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. <i>The tested animal must not be exposed to a hot sun in a
closed area.</i> In excess this will cause heat apoplexy, and the
fever heat which ushers this in, may easily be mistaken for the
indications of tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>6. <i>Cattle taken from pastures must not be enclosed in a hot,
stuffy stable.</i> While they must be tied up to allow of the temperature
being taken at short intervals, coolness and ventilation
should be secured in summer by a sufficient air space and the
requisite ventilating openings.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. <i>Exposure to cold draughts between open doors and windows,
or to wet or chilly blasts out of doors should be carefully guarded
against.</i> A chill proceeding from any source and alike in the
presence or absence of tuberculin causes a rise of the internal
body temperature.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. <i>Heavy cows unaccustomed to stand on hard boards may
have a rise of temperature in connection with resulting tenderness of
the feet.</i> One must avoid hard floors on the day of the test or
make examination of feet and allow for attendant fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. <i>Omission of the previous milking or a change of milker and
consequent retention of part of the milk</i> will raise the temperature
of a nervous cow, and in careless hands secure an erroneous condemnation.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. <i>Privation of water at the regular time will often cause rise
of temperature</i> especially when on the dry feeding of winter. I
have seen a general rise of two degrees and upward from the
delay of watering for a single hour, while after watering the
temperature went down to the normal and remained so. Water
always tends to a temporary lowering of temperature but in the
presence of tuberculosis it soon rises again.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. <i>Change of food is liable to produce a slight indigestion and
rise of temperature.</i> This should be avoided as far as possible,
and when a herd is taken up from pasture for the test, it should
have grass, ensilage or other succulent food.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. Cattle just from a long journey by road or rail, or other
cause of violent exertion are liable to have an elevated temperature
from the leucomain poisoning. Such should be left at rest
until the transient fever shall have subsided.</p>

<p class='c008'>13. Violent handling of nervous cows in taking the temperature
must be carefully avoided. The operator who cannot handle
them gently is not fit for this work.</p>

<p class='c008'>14. There must be evidence that the animals have not been repeatedly
tested at short intervals shortly before. In a number of
instances I have found a proportion of the cattle irresponsive to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>tuberculin, though a <i>post mortem</i> proved the presence of tuberculosis.
Unscrupulous men, wishing to sell on a guarantee, can
avail of this in animals so unaffected by the test.</p>

<p class='c008'>15. The operator must have absolute control, even of the feeding
and watering of the animals on the day of testing. Otherwise
the rise of temperature may be prevented by a liberal use of
antipyretics and a false guarantee may be secured.</p>

<p class='c008'>16. An unthrifty animal, having general symptoms suggesting
tuberculosis, must be subjected to the most critical examination
in addition to the tuberculin which in such animals often fails to
cause hyperthermia. Fortunately in such animals the tubercles
are usually numerous and extensive enough to be discovered
through objective symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>17. Animals excluded from the test by reason of some individual
unfitness at the time (parturition, œstrum, abortion or any
other disease) must be marked and held for the test later after
such disqualification shall have passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>18. The operator must bear in mind the possibility of transferring
other diseases from animal to animal, by contact, by the
use of the same hypodermic needle on two in succession, and
above all by the clinical thermometer. Diseases like contagious
abortion, which present no obvious symptoms in the intervals,
are especially liable to be carried in this way, and instances of
the active extension of this after a test, have come under my
notice. The operator should always enquire carefully as to the
existence of abortions and sterility in the herd, put the aborting
animals by themselves, using a special thermometer upon them,
and carefully washing the hands before going to other cattle. It
is well further to clean the thermometer after each animal and
disinfect it with carbolic acid solution (5:100).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dose of Tuberculin.</i> Of the usual American preparation 2cc.
(30 drops) is adapted to a cow or ox of 1,000 to 1,200 pounds.
For larger and smaller animals a moderate encrease or reduction
must be made, yet a considerable latitude is allowable. The
new-born calf will take five drops and the animal of 700 pounds
25 drops.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Technique of the Operation.</i> Lapses are so easily made when
dealing with a large herd and are so dangerous that a regular
plan should be systematically followed. The following will be
found simple and convenient:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>1. Inject the herd at 10 or 11 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> to secure a good rest and
be fresh for the rise of temperature early next morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Before injecting have the subjects arranged in order and
record them by name or other means of identification, with age,
sex, breed, weight, pregnant or not, past or prospective date of
calving, abortion, indications of disease, temperature taken just
before injection and appropriate dose.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Inject into the loose connective tissue on the side of the
neck, the animal being held by the nose, if necessary, by an
assistant.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Use a syringe which has not been employed for any infectious
products, and see that it is thoroughly cleansed and disinfected
by boiling or by filling it with a carbolic acid solution
(5:100).</p>

<p class='c008'>5. After drawing the appropriate dose into the syringe, wipe
the nozzle and dip it in strong carbolic acid before inserting it
into the skin. This safely disinfects any virulent matter that
may be lodged on the surface of the skin, and obviates those infected
swellings and abscesses that have been a cause of complaint
by stock owners.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. When the nozzle is withdrawn from the skin, wipe it and
dip it again into the strong carbolic acid to prevent any risk of infecting
the tuberculin into which it is to be plunged.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. The nozzle is much more easily inserted in the skin if the
latter is pinched up so that the needle will transfix it at a right
angle, instead of passing through a greater amount of the dense
tissue because of the oblique direction. An excited animal with
a thick, tense hide and a contracted panniculus muscle will offer
serious obstruction which lessens greatly as the subject gets over
its excitement and the muscle relaxes.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Temperature should be taken at 6 or 7 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, eight hours
after injection of tuberculin, and every two hours thereafter,
until the sixteenth hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. If any subject shows no rise of temperature until the 16th
hour after injection, its examination may be discontinued, but if
it shows a slight rise toward the 16th hour it should be continued
until it has shown a distinct reaction with steady rise and fall, or
until, without such distinct reaction, the temperature descends to
the normal.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>10. If one has shown a distinct reaction but is still rising at
the 16th hour, it should be continued till it begins to fall. The
typical reaction is one in which the rise and fall are both gradual,
and extend over a number of hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. In recording the temperatures, there should be noted the
exact time of each feeding, watering and milking, or any other
condition (change of weather), which may in any way affect the
heat production or radiation.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. In old, emaciated animals and in second or third tests,
Pearson uses twice the usual dose of tuberculin or more.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis Reaction.</i> With slight variations different operators
make their estimate of tuberculosis reaction on nearly the
same general basis. A rise of 2° F. over the highest temperature
of the day or days before, in the absence of any other appreciable
cause, and provided that the elevation has followed the tuberculosis
type of gradual rise and fall, is held to condemn. If, however,
this rise does not exceed the normal average, if the temperature
before injection did not exceed 100° and that after injection
102°, the case may well be held in doubt and reserved for
re-testing. If, on the contrary, the initial temperature of the
animal was 103°, and there was, between the 8th and 16th hours,
a gradual typical rise and fall, reaching 104° or a little over, in
the absence of any other cause for this, the subject would be condemned.
Cattle having an initial temperature of 103° or above
are not favorable subjects for the test, except in the case of
calves in which the temperature is normally higher and the reaction
must reach a higher point. In all cases of doubt it is well
to hold for a second test, unless urgent sanitary considerations
demand that a herd should be freed from the infection in short
order. Then it may be better to risk a single error, with the
concurrence of the owner, than to leave a possible centre of infection
in the herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Local swelling in the seat of injection may be charged to lack
of antiseptic care, or the presence of septic germs in the system
of the animal prior to injection.</p>

<p class='c008'>A chill during the period of reaction is not uncommon, especially
in cold weather, or in a draught of cold air. The coat may
stare along the spine in patches, or generally, tremors may be
seen on the body or limbs, and a clammy coldness invades the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>ears and horns, and especially the points of the hocks and ischia.
The back is sometimes arched and the feet drawn together somewhat.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the absence of any source of excitement the head may be
less elevated, the ears lopped forward or drawn back, and even
the eyelids may droop somewhat. These phenomena may last
for a few minutes or for an hour or two.</p>

<p class='c008'>In testing other genera consideration must be had of the different
normal temperature (horse 99.5°, dog 98.5°, sheep or pig
103°, bird 106°), and the varying susceptibility to tuberculin,
the Guinea pig requiring a maximum dose relatively to its size
and man or horse a minimum.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Effect of Tuberculin Test on the Later Average Health of the
Animal Reacting.</i> The transient fever and reaction on the day
after injection modifies the milk secretion temporarily to a certain
extent in ratio with the hyperthermia. The consensus of veterinarians
of the largest experience, and the voice of the International
Veterinary Congress at Berne in 1895, oppose the doctrine
of any continuous effect on the health even of the tuberculous.
Yet in the case of Governor Morton’s large herd of Guernseys a
careful record of temperatures showed that for weeks after the
test the reacting animals presented oscillations which were not
shown before, and which were not found to occur in the sound
animals. In the activities of sanitary work such indications are
easily missed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Effect of Tuberculin Test on Sound Animals.</i> In 1894 I tested
this on a number of thoroughbred Jersey and grade cows, injecting
them six times at intervals of from five to fourteen days. It
led to no appreciable change of the general health as shown by
the temperature, breathing, pulse, yield of milk or its quality.
Careful analysis was made of the milk at each milking, and in
two animals soundness was attested by <i>post mortem</i> examination.
Similar tests made by the Bureau of Animal Industry and others
led to the same results. Cows in which the yield of milk was on
the gain continued to encrease in the same ratio as those that had
not been injected, and those in which it was on the wane showed
no more rapid decrease. The butter fats and total solids showed
no variation more than appeared in the healthy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Action of Tuberculin on Parturient Cows.</i> The testimony of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>Bang, Eber and Pearson, based on a very extensive experience,
would indicate that the tuberculin test is not forbidden by the
parturient condition. Eber concludes that unless the initial temperature
materially exceeds 39.5° C. (103° F.) the parturient
state is no barrier to successful testing. My own experience, on
the contrary, is that a considerable proportion of parturient cows
give a reaction when the initial temperature did not exceed
103° F., and when no sign of tuberculosis could be found. As
an example, a cow in high condition, with an initial temperature
of 102.8° F., rose gradually from the eleventh hour after injection
and reached 106.3° by the eighteenth, a rise of 3.5°. From
the record she was not due to calve for three months, but a fortnight
later, when already killed and laid open, she showed all
the signs of parturition, a fully matured calf, and not a trace of
tubercle. This is far from unusual, and I am convinced that
many errors will be avoided by refusing to condemn parturient
animals or those within a couple of weeks before or after parturition
on the tuberculin test alone.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Reliability of the Tuberculin Test.</i> Even in the most careful
hands the tuberculin test cannot be held to be infallible. A certain
very small proportion of cows react without the recognition
of any tubercle post mortem, some because of other bodily conditions,
like parturition or abortion, but in skilled hands these may
be ignored in ordinary sanitary work. Pearson claims to have had
but 8 such cases in 4400 cows that gave a typical reaction. He
suspects that some of these even had undiscovered tubercle, and
Nocard thinks that all such cases are to be explained in this way.
On the other hand a very few really tuberculous animals fail to
react, some in connection with advanced disease, some because of
repeated previous testing, and some because of the introduction
of antipyretic agents into the system, but such cases can either be
detected and controlled or are so infinitesimal in numbers, that
they can be safely ignored in sanitary work. In skilled hands,
the tuberculin test will show at least ⁹⁄₁₀ths of all cases of tuberculosis,
when other methods of diagnosis will not detect ⅒th.
See above case of herd where objective symptoms showed nothing,
yet tuberculin condemned half the mature cattle, and post
mortem confirmed this, the skeptical veterinarian being judge.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span><i>The Relation of the Bacillus Tuberculosis of Man to that of Cattle.</i>
On the discovery of the bacillus tuberculosis it was largely
assumed that it was the same in all tuberculous animals, in all
organs and in all circumstances. But it was soon found that the
bacillus of chicken tuberculosis differed materially from that of
the mammalian, that it could be inoculated only with difficulty on
cattle or Guinea pig, as could that of the latter on the bird. The
bacillus of the chicken found a most receptive home in the rabbit
and horse, and was more easily started in artificial culture in
glycerine bouillon, than was that of man or ox. But presently it
appeared that the affinities and disparities did not end here. The
bacillus from man or ox led to much more pronounced lesions in
Guinea pigs than in rabbits, and the abdominal bacillus of the
horse was inoculable on the chicken. Both horse and parrot
proved receptive to the bacillus from man. Swine, like Guinea
pigs showed a receptiveness to the bacillus of man or ox. The
bacilli from the sputum, open tuberculous sore, or bones of man
showed less virulence for Guinea pigs and rabbits than did those
from tubercles in the human lungs and liver. The bacillus from
the ox showed a greater virulence toward rodents and other small
animals than did the bacillus from man. The bacillus of human
sputum inoculated on the ox did not habitually cause generalized
tuberculosis, but oftentimes a local tubercle or group of tubercles,
and sometimes the inoculation wound healed without permanent
lesion. These last points were seized upon to sustain a doctrine
of probable duality for the microbe of tuberculosis, but if duality
it was quite evident it could not end there, but must be extended
to multiplicity, each small group of genera having a tubercle
bacillus peculiar to itself. Those who thought their interest lay
in arresting all sanitary control of tuberculous cattle and their
products, became urgent in opposition to active government measures,
demanding mathematical proof of the infection of man from
cattle, under conditions that would exclude the remotest possibility
of the introduction of infection from another source. The
clearest and most abundant circumstantial evidence would not
suffice, they must have direct experimental inoculation under conditions
of precaution against outside germs, which were practically
impossible in any community, conveniently ignoring that
such inoculation, if successful, would have amounted to manslaughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>and that no such experimental evidence has been had,
or can be had, of any of the deadly diseases of man. Infection
by exposure and accidental inoculations can be had in abundance,
just as they can in tuberculosis, but never under the rigid precautions
which would exclude the possibility of extraneous infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject has assumed such importance that I may be excused
for introducing a portion of my paper read before the New York
State Medical Society in 1900.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. <i>This Variability is Common to Microbes Generally.</i> Certain
bacilli, like those of anthrax, grow in the living body as rods
only, but become long filaments in given artificial media. They
produce no spores in the living tissue, but do so readily in the
carcass or soil. Transferred from ox to ox they are generally
fatal, but if grown for several generations in Guinea pigs, and
then transferred to cattle, the resulting disease is slight (Burdon-Sanderson,
Duguid, Greenfield). Rabies passed from dog to
dog is almost constantly fatal, but if passed through the ape and
then back to the dog it is comparatively harmless (Pasteur). In
both these cases the inoculated animals become immune from the
more virulent germs, showing that they have passed through the
actual disease in an unusually mild form. The later system of
Pasteur is founded on this same general truth, as are also the
methods of lessening the pathogenesis of germs by subjecting
them to compressed oxygen, to graduated heating, to an altered
chemical condition of the culture medium, to antisepsis, etc. For
a time such weakened cultures often retain their lessened pathogenesis,
even through a succession of cultures in a susceptible
animal body, acting as if the germ were indeed a distinct species.
But it might well have been considered that a microbe which had
changed its aptitudes in a given environment could presumably
revert to its original habits under the incentive of a suitable
medium. And this is precisely what does take place. Pasteur
has shown that the less potent rabic virus becomes more potent
when passed several times through the body of a rabbit, and that
the weakened anthrax germ acquires greater force when passed
through a series of small birds or newly-born mammals.</p>

<p class='c008'>To come to tuberculosis, Trudeau tells us that a culture of bacillus
tuberculosis from man inoculated on the rabbit, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>cultivated for two years <i>in vitro</i>, becomes much less destructive
to Guinea pigs, and that after six years of such artificial culture
all the Guinea pigs inoculated with it live for many months, some
for two and a half years, and some even recover. The usual life
of the Guinea-pig after inoculation is seventeen days.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c023'><sup>[3]</sup></a> All of our
zymotic diseases have in a similar way cycles of malignancy and
benignancy. For a series of years measles, scarlatina, diphtheria,
smallpox, or grippe have an unwonted mildness, and, again, one
or another merges into a cycle of extreme and fatal malignancy.
Rinderpest on the steppes of Asia is comparatively harmless to
the native stock, but among outside cattle imported into the steppes
or attacked in their native lands it is habitually fatal. Texas
fever is mild among the indigenous cattle in the Gulf States, but
very deadly to Northern stock. Glanders is not at all fatal to
horses of the plains, the Rockies, or the Sierras; but it becomes
redoubtable when these horses carry it to the Eastern seaboard,
and still more so in Western Europe. It is a common experience
to see a malady transformed through the effects of heredity or
acquired immunity, through environment or the temporary mitigation
of virulence in the germ; and again we see the same
disease, no longer restrained by such inhibitory conditions, bursting
forth as a malignant and deadly plague. We have, therefore,
no warrant for the hypothesis that a pathogenic germ which,
under given conditions of life, has lost in pathogenesis, but not
in vitality, should continue forever to exist as a harmless microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. <i>Varying Malignancy of the Tubercle Bacillus in Man.</i>
Nothing is more familiar to physicians than the slow progress of
tuberculosis of the lymph-glands and bones, on the one hand,
and its frequent rapid progress in pulmonary, abdominal, or
encephalic organs on the other. It has on this account been
rather difficult to persuade many of the etiological identity of
scrofula and consumption. In experimental tuberculosis the
same truth constantly crops up. Arloing and his followers found
that the tubercle bacillus from the lymph-glands of man proved
less virulent and deadly than that from the human lungs (<i>Lecons
sur la Tuberculose</i>). As early as 1880, Creighton drew attention
to this in his work on <i>Bovine Tuberculosis in Man</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>But the bacillus from the lungs is subject to variations of this
kind. Among seven specimens of human sputum, cultivated by
Theobald Smith, six had a fair average vitality, while the seventh
failed to perpetuate itself on dog serum.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c023'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Journal of Experimental Medicine, 1898, No. 111.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It should be strongly emphasized in this connection that the
failure of extension and generalization of the sputum germ when
transferred to cattle does not distinguish it from the tubercle
bacillus as conveyed from ox to ox. Everyone at all experienced
with the tuberculin test well knows that in most herds the majority
of the tuberculous animals show no generalization, but only a localized
tuberculosis. There is reason to believe that even recoveries
take place after slight infection, and it is certain that many tuberculous
cattle continue for years in what appears to be good general
health. Unless in particularly susceptible subjects or under
specially poor hygienic conditions, or unless in case of reinfection,
the average bacillus of bovine origin habitually fails to produce
in other cattle a rapid extension and generalization.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. <i>Interchangeability of Bacillus of Man and Bird.</i> Of all
known forms of tubercle bacillus that of birds is the most distant
from that of man or ox, and yet the beautiful experiments of
Nocard<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c023'><sup>[5]</sup></a> serve to establish their essential identity. Taking the
bacillus of human sputum, which would not infect the fowl, he
enclosed it in collodion capsules, which confined the bacilli while
allowing transudation of the animal fluids, and left these in the
abdomen of the chicken for not less than four months. He
repeated this three times in succession with the product of the
original sputum germ, and obtained a bacillus which was actively
pathogenic for the chicken, though it had been harmless
after the sojourn of four and eight months respectively.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. Annales de l’Institut Pasteur, September, 1898.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This may explain the reported cases in which a flock of poultry
have developed tuberculosis a few months after they were placed
in the hands of a consumptive caretaker. That such transmission
does not always occur is not surprising, considering that transmission
between man and man is infrequent in comparison with
the number of exposures. So in cattle the majority of exposed
animals usually escape, although in such a case there can be no
plausible explanation on the ground of a difference of germ. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>have in every case to consider the necessity for receptivity as
well as infectivity, and the lack of either is a bar to infection.
When, however, we assume that the most diverse tubercle bacilli
are descendent’s of one original stock, that a large herd must furnish
some animals of more than usual susceptibility, and that
such animals are subjected to continuous accessions of both bacilli
and toxins, we can easily understand how some of the more
adaptable germs will in time accommodate themselves to the new
medium. A Pettinkoffer, with an immune constitution or a
specially vigorous gastric digestion, may with impunity drink a
culture of cholera spirillum, but the same is not true of the drunkard
fresh from a spree and with seriously impaired digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacillus Tuberculosis in Man and Ox. Points of Similarity.</i>
The bacillus tuberculosis of cattle is in general shorter and thicker
than those of man, but many in both subjects are morphologically
indistinguishable. Such differences are often far exceeded by
different specimens of one stock of germ seeded on different
media. There is no great difference in the thermal death point,
and the viability in light, dryness, cold and putrefaction. The
tendency is in all cases to colonize the lymph plexus or glands
and to develop the specific lesions, with slight variation in detail.
The slow development of the lesions from both forms of bacilli
and their histological similarity is another argument for their
essential identity. The slow growth of both on artificial media,
the demand of each for a medium having the same approximate
composition, and the similar pathogenic and diagnostic characters
of the toxic matters elaborated by both germs bespeak a primary
identity. The very remarkable staining qualities of tubercle
bacillus, from whatever source it may be drawn, are no less
remarkable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis of Man and Ox Coextensive.</i> The prevalence of
tuberculosis in man and ox in the same country and district is so
frequent that it may be safely set down as the rule. Among
ichthyophagists and great fishing communities, like the people of
the Hebrides, Iceland, Newfoundland, Greenland, and the coasts
of Hudson Bay, tuberculosis is rare. In these countries cattle
are few or absent, or, like the hardy highland kyloes of the
Hebrides, they are kept in the open air. The immunity of the
people is not due to insusceptibility, since they fall ready victims
to tuberculosis when removed to infected countries and cities.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>In Northern Sweden, Norway, Lapland and Finland, where
cattle are scarce and reindeer plentiful, tuberculosis is said to be
rare, though the inhabitants live in the closest of dwellings
through the long winter. In most of the Pacific islands there are
no cattle, and the natives are comparatively free from consumption.
In Hawaii, since the introduction of cattle, consumption
has increased. Australia and Tasmania, which forty years ago
were the great resorts for English consumptives, have become increasingly
the homes of infection since the development of the
cattle industry and the influx of phthisical subjects. Minnesota
and Dakota, in the early days, were held to be incompatible with
tuberculosis, but since the advent of the white man and his
stabled herds they have largely lost their sanitary reputation.
The highest known mortality from tuberculosis to-day is that of
the reservation Indians of these States, who feed on raw, diseased
beef. In the Kighiz steppes the Tartars subsist on the flesh and
milk of their solipeds, and largely escape consumption. In
Japan, Dr. Ashmead tells us that the common people escape
tuberculosis, while the aristocracy suffer severely. He attributes
this mainly to the debauchery of the ruling class; but it must not
be overlooked that they eat freely of beef and dairy products,
which the rice-eating poorer population do not. The same remarks
apply in measure to the mandarin and plebian classes in
China. Holden tells us that tuberculosis is rare in Columbia,
Ecuador and on the eastern slopes of the Andes, where little or
no milk or butter is used. It must be further borne in mind that
in these countries all herds live in the open air, and practically
escape infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>These examples must be contrasted with the consumers of beef
and milk in civilized temperate countries, where the stock are
largely kept indoors. A general average mortality of 7 or 8 per
cent. from tuberculosis, and the <i>post mortem</i> evidence in European
and American hospitals of 33 to 50 per cent. which show tubercular
lesions, recent or remote, cannot be lightly passed over.
The contrast with our reservation Indians is still more striking.
Holden and Treon testify that the meat furnished to the Indians
is always poor and often diseased, and that when the stock arrives
our hungry wards devour the internal organs raw, or, later, the
flesh as pounded preserved meat, and still uncooked. The deaths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>of these Indians from tuberculosis is 50 per cent. of the total
mortality.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c023'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Dr. Washington Matthews, who spent twenty-one
years among the Indians, gives their food as the main cause of
the disease, and states that when the supply of fresh meat is
liberal the death rate from tuberculosis is highest (Census of
1880).</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Medical Record, August 13, 1883.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If we now contrast this fearful mortality with the immunity of
the Indians of Hudson Bay, Great Slave Lake, Alaska, and the
North generally, we have a most suggestive picture. It may be
conceded that the extreme Northern Indians, being beyond the
cereal region, have a slight measure of protection in their meat
diet; but the recent spread of tuberculosis, like a plague, among
the inhabitants of Barrow Straits, when introduced by the frozen-in
whalers and the relief party, is sufficient disproof of any claim of
special insusceptibility. There can be no doubt that in this, as
in other virulent diseases, the rule holds that the long absence of
the infection secures the preservation of the susceptible lines of
blood, so that when the contagion does come it finds a more inviting
field than in countries in which the more susceptible strains
have been killed off and the comparatively immune have survived.
Toward the Arctic circle the Indian must crowd into closer quarters
in winter than his brother further south; but, in spite of all,
the beef-eating Indian is being rapidly exterminated by tuberculosis,
to which his brother of the north is a comparative stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Exceptions: Their Explanation.</i> This statement would be incomplete
without a notice of exceptions to the rule. The Cape
Town branch of the British Medical Association reports “that
tuberculosis is rapidly increasing there in the human population,
while tubercle in cattle is almost nonexistent.” This finds an
abundant explanation in the different conditions of life. The
men live indoors and concentrate the infection, whereas the cattle
enjoy an outdoor life and escape. In a latitude of 30° south,
where frost is rare, and with a dry climate (12 to 30 inches
of rain per annum), the colonists find no occasion for housing their
cattle, so that the conditions for the prevention of tuberculosis are
ideal. It may be added that cattle are far less numerous in Cape
Colony than they formerly were. The destruction first by lung
plague and later by rinderpest has made the cattle industry extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>hazardous, and even before the advent of the rinderpest
many had abandoned cattle and taken to sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'>Parallel cases can be found in other countries. In Egypt, the
great resort of consumptives, cattle are almost immune, the abattoirs
furnishing about one tuberculous ox in ten thousand killed.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c023'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
From Tunis (Alix), Algiers (Sarciron, Plaise), and Senegambia
(Lenoir) a similar testimony comes. Cattle imported from Europe
may die of tuberculosis, which is liable to assume a rapidly fatal
type; but the native cattle, kept in the open air, are practically
exempt.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Jersey cattle in their native island, staked out at pasture all
the year round, show little or no tuberculosis, whereas the housed
Jerseys of England and America suffer severely. The cattle of
our Gulf Coast States, kept on ranches in the open air, are largely
immune, and the cattle of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and the Argentine
Republic largely escape; but the housed dairy cows of our
Southern cities show a very high ratio of consumptives. Consumption
becomes more and more deadly in the Southern negro
even in the country localities, while the outdoor cattle of the same
districts escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>The absence of tuberculosis from the sanitarium herd at Saranac
requires to be explained on a different basis. This herd is housed
in winter, and infection, once introduced, would have opportunity
to spread. The absence of tuberculosis is highly complimentary
to the management of the establishment. But a similar immunity
is the rule for all well-managed sanitariums, and not as regards
cattle only, but man as well. At Argeles no case of tuberculosis
contagion to attendants occurred in ten years (Ferrand). At
Soden baths, in a village of 1500, there were in thirty-four years
65 deaths, 15 from consumption (Hopt). At Falkenstein, in
fifteen years, one attendant became tuberculous (Jousset). At
Görbersdorf the cases of consumption in the village and environs
decreased (Knopf). At Brompton, London, in thirty-six years,
among 150 attendants, but one became consumptive, though they
individually served for from fifteen to twenty-four years, and
nearly 40,000 patients had been received.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c023'><sup>[8]</sup></a> A well-conducted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>sanitarium is and should be a safer place than the average community,
in which 15 per cent. and upward are tuberculous. The
educational influence of such an institution should decrease tuberculosis
in the surrounding districts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nocard relates that a Beauce farmer, with a finely appointed
stable and healthy herd, in 1883 employed a dairyman who had
cough, profuse expectoration, and occasional hæmoptysis, and who
had been several times in the hospital in consequence. He slept
in the cow stable directly over the cows. In 1886 two cows,
stalled immediately beneath him, showed ill health and were put
up to fatten, but did badly and showed extensive tuberculosis when
butchered. The dairyman stayed until 1891, having to go to the
hospital several times in the interval. In 1892 the tuberculin test
was applied and seven more cows were found to be tuberculous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Huon tells of a cow bought to furnish milk for calves used to
raise vaccine. She stood the tuberculin test, and was carefully
secluded from all other cattle, but soon began to fall off, and in
six months was very much emaciated, responded to the tuberculin
test, and when killed showed extensive tuberculosis. Her caretaker
at the vaccine establishment had what was believed to be
chronic bronchitis, but when he died, soon after, this was found
to be extensive pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Howe, of North Hadley, Mass., lost a son, aged twenty
months, from abdominal tuberculosis, three months after he had
paid a week’s visit to his uncle and had been fed the milk of the
uncle’s tuberculous cow. The cow showed at death generalized
tuberculosis. The child had been strong and well, as were his
parents.</p>

<p class='c008'>The four-year-old son of Colonel Beecher, of Yonkers, died

<p class='c008'>Dr. Gosse, of Geneva, Switzerland, spent his Sundays with his
family on an estate in the hills, and his daughter, aged seventeen
years, took great pleasure in drinking milk warm from the cows.
Early in 1893 she sickened with an obscure illness, and after ten
months died, revealing at the necropsy intestinal and mesenteric
tuberculosis. The five cows on the estate were tested with tuberculin;
four reacted and were killed; two showed tuberculous

<p class='c008'>Dr. Kelly, veterinarian, Albany, gives the following: In a
family of five a son, aged nineteen years, was very fond of milk
and drank it fresh from the cow, and contracted tuberculosis.
Some months later the farm herd of seventeen registered Jerseys
were tested with tuberculin, and thirteen reacted and showed extensive
tuberculosis when killed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Cooper, veterinarian, Paterson, N. J., furnishes this: A
child, fed on the milk of a cow, contracted tabes mesenterica.
Examination revealed the presence of tubercle bacilli in the milk.
The milk was then fed to ten kittens, all of which became ill and
emaciated, and when killed showed tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such cases, in connection with the experimental inoculations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>furnish more than mere circumstantial evidence. They are corroborated
and strengthened by the very uniform diffusion of
tuberculosis in man and stalled cattle in practically all civilized
countries. Of the closer connection in individual cases one or
two instances may here be added as drawn from personal observation:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. In one case a family cow and the owner’s wife had both advanced
tuberculosis. The lady consumed a good deal of the
cow’s milk, but when she gave up its use she felt decidedly
better.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The owner of a thoroughbred herd of sixty head had suffered
for years from consumption, and attributed the poor condition
of the animals to lack of care since he had been laid aside.
Without the tuberculin test, I diagnosed tuberculosis in fifty-nine
of the animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. In a second thoroughbred herd there never lacked one or
two cases of advanced tuberculosis, two of the family suffered,
and the eldest son, who was fond of milk and vegetable food, died
of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. A dairy of common cows had seventeen out of twenty-six
destroyed for tuberculosis, and the farmer’s wife, father-in-law,
and two brothers-in-law had shortly before died of consumption.
The wife felt ill in the close house air, and with her father occupied
herself much about the cattle.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. A veterinary professor, who was meat inspector of the city
abattoir, died a few years ago of tuberculosis, which he handled
so constantly in his daily duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stalker and Niles report that 5 persons, 20 to 30 years of age,
of healthy ancestry, died of tuberculosis within two years, on a
farm where 17 tuberculous cattle were found, and others had
died in previous years, (Bull. Ia. Agr. Exp. Stat., 29).</p>

<p class='c008'>Leonhardt reports the death from tuberculosis, abdominal and
meningeal, of two children, fed on the milk of a tuberculous cow,
(Rep. N. H. Bd. of Health, 1892).</p>

<p class='c008'>Sontag reports the death by tuberculosis of a six months old
child of healthy parents, that had been fed the milk of a tuberculous
cow, (Rep. N. H. Board of Health, 1892).</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. E. Pearson quotes the following:</p>

<p class='c008'>“A well known veterinarian wounded in the hand in opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>a tuberculous cow, had a tumid, intractable sore, the tissues of
which when excised showed tubercle bacilli.</p>

<p class='c008'>A veterinarian, of Chester Co., Pa., in opening a tuberculous
cow, cut his knuckle, which healed tardily, remained swollen
and when excised, showed typical tubercular lesions including
giant cells.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He quotes from Hartzell the cases of two men wounded in
cleaning cattle cars, both of whom had resulting tubercle, arrested
in one case by excision, but in the other advanced to generalized
tuberculosis and death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bang gives the following Danish cases:</p>

<p class='c008'>A merchant having two chlorotic daughters secured a fine cow
to feed them fresh milk. The cow was killed tuberculous and was
replaced by another which also showed tuberculosis, this time
affecting the udder. The girls died of tuberculosis at 16 and 18
years. Two younger children fed on the milk of sound cows
grew up healthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>A healthy cow became tubercular, after having been placed in
the same stall in which another had died of tuberculosis. A
child fed almost exclusively on the milk of these two cows died of
tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>A peasant at Silkeborg drank freely of milk freshly drawn.
He died of tuberculosis, as did also a cow, and later in the same
stable, a pig.</p>

<p class='c008'>A peasant had an 11 year old cow with generalized tuberculosis,
implicating the udder. The wife of the peasant, formerly
healthy, became tuberculous shortly after the udder became affected
and died at 45. A daughter who, like her mother, used
the milk of this cow, died consumptive in the same year. The
husband who drank beer, and not milk, remained well.</p>

<p class='c008'>A physician fed his two children on the milk of his tubercular
cow, and lost both from tuberculosis. Neither parents nor
grand-parents were tuberculous. (L. Pearson in Bull. 75, Tuberculosis
of Cattle).</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorne had reports from twenty-two Ohio physicians to the
effect that they had traced tuberculosis in their patients to the
use of the milk of tuberculous cows, and thirty-three who believed
they had reason to suspect the meat and milk supply as the
source of cases of consumption. (Ohio Exp. Stat. Bull. 108).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>To these may be added the cutaneous forms of tuberculosis
(tuberculosis verrucosa cutis), which occur on the hands of persons
(butchers, tanners, coachmen, cooks, etc.), who handle infected
products of animals. These have been described by Riehl
and Paltauf, Senn, and a number of surgeons and dermatologists
and the relation of the occupation to the seat of the disease is conclusive
as to the source of the infection. It is the exact counterpart
of the verrucosa necrogenica of the hands of persons working
in the dissecting rooms of medical schools, and the source of infection
is equally well established in both cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>A strong argument for the appreciable influence of the bovine
bacillus upon man (acting directly or indirectly through the pig)
is that the relative death rate of Jews from tuberculosis is materially
less than that of other races. It is constantly claimed that
orthodox Jews who eat only kosher (rabbi inspected) beef and no
pork, suffer least of all the population from tuberculosis. Dr.
Gerster, judging by the burial returns of the United Synagogue
and the English Registrar General’s returns, concludes that only
about half the relative proportion of Hebrews suffer from consumption
as do other races in the same country. Some remarkable
facts come out in the report of the Royal Commission on
tuberculosis in England. In England and Wales the disease had
decreased 39.1 per cent, in thirty-five years, but this decrease has
been mainly in pulmonary cases, while the abdominal forms decreased
only 8.5 per cent. Sir Richard Thorne, indeed says, that
in children of the first year there had been an actual encrease of
27.7 per cent. Northrup and Still, on the contrary, present statistics
showing that in children the pulmonary form of tuberculosis
is the most common (Brit. Med. Jour. 1898). If in the face
of this there has been a very material encrease of the abdominal
form, coincident with the notorious encrease of the disease in
dairy cows and of the bottle-feeding of infants, may we not enquire
how much of this is due to the greater prevalence of bottle-feeding
and the infected cow’s milk? It is not for a moment
supposed that the majority of infections in children come from
the cow. The question is whether this encrease in the minority
is not in measure chargeable on the cow. The impaired nutrition
resulting in some instances from the use of cow’s milk cannot
well be charged with a marked encrease of cases in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>mesenteric tubercles point so directly to infection through the
food. If it is held that the tubercle bacilli in the milk are harmless,
we wait for evidence of the real cause of such encrease and
localization.</p>

<p class='c008'>The experiments of Adami show that tubercle is directly transmissible
from man to ox though usually with decreased virulence.
More recently, Ravenel using the bacillus derived from the mesenteric
glands of a child, injected intravenously two tuberculin-tested
calves, with 5cc. each of the culture producing exalted
hyperthermia, miliary tuberculosis of the lungs, tuberculosis and
caseation of the bronchial and mediastinal glands, and death in
17 days. Dr. Garnault’s experiment on himself, now in progress,
has already shown the great danger to a susceptible man, of
the bovine bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'>As showing accommodation to environment, Battaillon and
Ferre found that the bacillus (mammalian and avian) grown in
frogs, Dubard that grown in fishes, Kráhl that grown in frogs,
snakes, fishes and lizards, and Müeller that grown in the glow
worm, thereafter grew at summer temperature (68° F.) and grew
poorly or not at all in the bodies of mammalia.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tubercle bacillus is primarily and essentially one, but this
must not close our eyes to the fact that in different hosts and
environments it takes on very different habits, so that for the
time and in these surroundings, it is materially modified in its
pathogenic attitude toward different races. Yet its ready variability
when conditions are favorable to change, renders it desirable
to destroy it in all its forms, and especially in those which
approximate most closely to those that prey on man and animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>An impartial review of the whole field warrants the conclusion
that the nineteen young (and therefore comparatively insusceptible)
cattle which in Koch’s hands failed to develop generalized
tuberculosis after inoculation with the virulent sputum of man,
and the smaller numbers that resulted in the same way under
similar treatment in the hands of Th. Smith, Dinwiddie and
Adami, while showing a very marked limitation in the susceptibility
of the sound bovine system to weak bacilli from man, cannot
disprove the many well authenticated cases of the transmission
of tuberculosis from cow to man and the reverse. The
greater potency of the bovine bacillus over that of man, in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>action on the small rodents and pigs, utterly forbids the unproved
assumption that it is on the contrary harmless to man.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the object of the sanitarian were merely to delay a fatal result
in his tuberculous patient, while he accepted the prevalence
of tuberculosis as inevitable for all future time, the acknowledged
lessened receptivity of the ox for the bacillus from man would
mean more and would be at least worthy of a hearing, but as the
extinction of a disease germ and its representative plague must
ever be the first object, any movement toward the preservation in
cattle of a germ which is deadly to man and much more so to
cattle, must be held as subversive of the prime purpose of sanitary
work. This is true even if we allow, for the sake of argument,
that only a few of the bovine bacilli are capable of dangerously
colonizing the human body, and that special environment
is needful to allow of such successful colonization. On the other
hand the limited receptivity of the ox for the bacillus from man
is the greatest encouragement to active work to exterminate
tuberculosis from our herds. It is impossible to adopt in man
the summary measures that are so successful in the speedy <i>stamping
out</i> of the plagues of the lower animals, so that tuberculosis
in the human family can only be eradicated by slow degrees, and
therefore there will long continue for our herds the danger from
the human side, but just so far as the susceptibility of cattle to
human tuberculosis is limited, in the same ratio are our hands
strengthened in effective work for the extinction of consumption
in our herds and for preserving their soundness after they have
once been purified. If they were to be reinfected by the presence
of any consumptive person we might well despair of success in
face of a wide prevalence of tuberculosis in man, but since it is
only exceptionally that cattle suffer from man, outbreaks coming
from this source can the more easily be taken care of. In this
view tuberculosis is approximated somewhat more closely to the
other bovine plagues (lung plague, rinderpest) which can be
stamped out with the greatest ease and certainty, so that as a
purely economic measure the argument for the speedy extinction
of tuberculosis in our herds is reinforced.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Like all deadly infectious diseases in the lower animals, tuberculosis
is not to be profitably treated as a rule. In the case of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>specially valuable breeding animals, in which the prospective
progeny will pay for large outlay, and when the disease is in its
incipient stage, treatment may be warranted. The patient should
be thoroughly separated from other animals, kept in the open air,
or, in our northern winters, in roomy, well ventilated buildings
facing the south, well lighted, kept immaculately clean, frequently
whitewashed, and well drained. If there are more than one case
every precaution named under the head of prevention must be
adopted. Exercise to keep the muscular system in good tone is
called for, but never to fatigue. Hence, a sheltered pasturage is
ideal. Feeding must be liberal including a ration of grain or
seeds, and oil bearing seeds like linseed, rape seed or cotton seed
may be specially named. Cod liver oil alone, or etherized is often
of great value, with iron and bitters continued for weeks or
months. In the case of specially valuable animals one may use a
pneumatic cabinet the principle of which is to diminish the air
pressure on the body at large by an exhaust, while pure air for
breathing, at the ordinary atmospheric pressure, is introduced
through a tube furnished with a face piece fitting around closely
beneath the eyes. This serves the purpose of attracting (sucking)
the blood toward the skin and other tissues from the lungs, which
in their turn are compressed by the air at the atmospheric pressure.
Pulmonary congestion is in this way lessened, exudates are
absorbed, necrotic tissue removed, sepsis counteracted, hæmatosis
encreased, circulation of both blood and lymph stimulated, digestion
and nutrition improved, and general health invigorated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Active grooming and even the stimulating effect of cold douches
may be invoked, the skin being rubbed actively until dry and
warm.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the circulation is poor, a stimulating steam or hot water bath
of fifteen minutes followed by a cold sponge and rubbing till dry
may be profitably substituted. In such cases it is well to put a
cold sponge on the head while in the bath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Medicated inhalation is often valuable especially when the
lesions are on, or near the bronchial mucosa. In 1868, Dewar met
with most successful results from inhalation of sulphurous acid
gas impregnating the atmosphere as strongly as the patient can
breath without discomfort. His own groom who had given up
work because of advanced phthisis, under treatment of half an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>hour three times a day, became ruddy, gained weight, and betook
himself to work again. In rabbits which I inoculated with human
sputa, the same year, all died tuberculous excepting one which I
fumigated three times a day for weeks. This rabbit remained
plump and well.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an example of a still more irritating inhalant, I watched the
case of a phthisical man who secured employment on the government
disinfecting corps, in Chicago, in purifying the lung-plague-infected
stables with chloride of lime solution, and who very soon
began to improve, gaining weight and strength, his cough meanwhile
subsiding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cervello’s use of formalina by inhalation though well spoken of
by its inventor would seem too irritating on the delicate lungs,
however good it is as an antiseptic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inhalants may be conjoined with the pneumatic cabinet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among agents used to moderate the cough may be named
codeine, morphia, cherry laurel water, wild cherry bark, guaiacol,
menthol, syrup of Tolu, or chloroform, or alcohol inhalation.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an internal antiseptic, carbonate of creosote has often
proved beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mustard blisters on the skin covering the tubercle is claimed
by Knopf to act beneficially by attracting the microbes from the
delicate lungs to the more robust skin and connective tissue,
where they can be better disposed of by the more abundant
leucocytes.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has also found excellent results in complex infections in
animals from the use of Marmorek’s streptococcic serum in doses
of 10cc., followed after the second dose by 5cc. every 24 hours.
In other cases it failed of the effect (reduction to normal temperature)
evidently indicating that the hyperthermia was maintained
by other microbes than the streptococcus. The principle is good,
and perhaps at some time in the future a bacteriological examination
of the sputum may reveal the microbes present and suggest
the sera for such complications.</p>

<p class='c008'>The introduction of air into the peritoneum has long been
known to exercise a retarding and curative action on abdominal
tuberculosis. At the present writing my colleague, V. A. Moore,
is experimenting by pumping air and oxygen into the peritoneum
and pleuræ in cattle slightly affected, with encouraging results.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>I should add that isolated superficial tubercles may often be
excised to advantage, and the part dressed antiseptically.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is only in exceptional cases, however, that one is warranted
in preserving and running the danger of spreading the tubercle
bacillus for the advantage that can be secured to individual animals
from treatment.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>EXTINCTION OF TUBERCULOSIS IN CATTLE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>As cattle are the great propagators of tuberculosis on the
farm, the question of extinction necessarily centres around this
race. As in all other dangerous infections, the most prompt and
successful method would be in the time honored one of destroying
the infected and thoroughly disinfecting all their products. The
only barrier to success in such a case would be the conveyance of
infection anew from man to cattle after the herd had been purified.
The demonstration that cattle are less susceptible to infection
by the human sputa than many had supposed does away
largely with this objection, as in a generally purified bovine race,
the few primary cases contracted from man could be easily taken
care of. Then, if tuberculous persons were interdicted from attendance
on cattle, the danger in this direction would become
very nearly a negligible quantity.</p>

<p class='c008'>There remains the question of expense and many honestly
consider this as absolutely prohibitory. The estimate of 5 per
cent. of our 68,000,000 head to be killed and paid for at $25 per
head, would be $85,000,000. But there is no necessity for this.
Our fat steers at the packing houses are tuberculous only to the
extent of 0.02 per cent., speaking well for their dams and nurses.
The estimate of 5 per cent., based upon the testing of those few
herds that have been taken because they were already known to
be tuberculous, is unquestionably far above the actual ratio for
the United States. It may apply to dairy cattle in some infected
districts, but, for the bovine race of the whole country, it is absurdly
high. If we had 10, 20 or 50 per cent. infected, as in
some countries of Europe, the objection of expense might be a
formidable one, but when the ratio of the infected is but 2:10000,
we have every encouragement on the score of expense to enter
on a campaign of extinction. But again, we do not need to deal
with 68,000,000 cattle as we can omit the steers which are so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>little affected and which will all come to the slaughter house in
two or three years. The source of their infection (a few cases
excepted) is in the older cows and bulls of the dairy and breeding
herds, and this brings down our total to a little over 17,000,000.
The average census price for dairy cows is $29 and, as the condemned
cows are depreciated by their condition, it would be a
high average to estimate them at $20. Again, the average infected
ratio of cows for the entire country would be set high at 2
per cent., and on this basis it might well be that the required indemnity
would not aggregate much over $6,000,000. Five or
even ten times that amount would be a mere trifle in comparison
with the $3,000,000,000 value, constantly encreasing, of our domestic
animals, with the $99,210,272, representing our yearly
product of beef and beef products, with our annual dairy products,
worth $500,000,000, (Alford), or with our yearly loss of
100,000 of our population in the very prime of life when they are
of the greatest value to the country, representing a yearly drain
of $100,000,000, beside all the suffering and loss entailed by their
prolonged and too often helpless idleness. Though this last item
is doomed to continue for a length of time after the disease has
been extinguished in our herds, it is receiving constant accessions
from the latter, and can never be entirely done away with
until our cattle are above suspicion.</p>

<p class='c008'>An even more serious problem is the demand for tuberculin and
above all for accomplished, experienced and honorable veterinarians
fitted to conduct the sanitary campaign over the entire
country. The tuberculin cannot be produced in a week or a
month, yet the problem of its production in any required amount
in a few months is merely one of the encrease of existing plants
under the management of the same careful hands now engaged
upon it. As to veterinarians it would be impossible to secure at
once the required staff of men capable of carrying out the work
over the whole country. But this is not essential. The work
can be begun in the counties supplying the large cities with milk,
and in the great butter and cheese producing areas where it is so
urgently needed, and it must be made to include all thoroughbred
herds, which are so constantly drawn upon to improve the blood
elsewhere, and each herd, county and district, as freed from infection
must be scheduled and no additions made to it from outside,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>except under the guarantee of the tuberculin test, repeated in six
months. The reacting animals, must be appraised, excluded
from the herd, and disposed of, it may be to the butcher to be
killed under official expert inspection, and the salvage, if any, to
be deducted from the appraised value; or to be rendered and the
salvage estimated; or to be buried as the case may be. In all
such cases the other animals (horses, pigs) that occupy the same
buildings and yards should be tested, although the risk of the
infection of cattle from these animals is comparatively small.
Unless in badly infected herds, steers and young cattle, which
can be kept in a separate herd need not be tested. Vermin must
be killed. Thorough disinfection must be applied to buildings
and yards, and the dairy herd must be retested at the end of every
six months until no more reactions are met with.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this way the campaign in any State can be begun with a
small staff, which may be steadily encreased as men are trained
to the work, and in no great length of time the dairying and
breeding herds can be purified and the investigation carried into
the more purely agricultural fields, where herds are small and
usually free from infection. Many minor points would require
the attention of a competent superintendent of the work. My
object here is to make a plea for the approved and attested method
which has never failed in the case of other animal infections on
enclosed farms, and which is based on the absolute destruction of
every seed of the disease in the area under sanitary control. The
method has the apparent drawback, that it demands a greater
relative outlay at the start, than do others proposed, but in view
of its certainty, and the confident hope of an early abolition of all
infection, loss, and expensive expert control, it must, in my
opinion, be looked upon here, as it has always proved in the past,
the course of the truest economy. It may be compared to the
treatment of a field of thistles by removing the offensive weeds,
root and branch, before they have advanced to seed, instead of
merely cutting them down with a mower, and leaving the roots,
to grow anew, to leaf, to blossom and seed, in spite of the
temporary partial drawback. But as the prospect of early legislation
along this line is not a bright one, the expert must accommodate
his aims and efforts to what can be done under the existing
laws.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span><i>Breeding Healthy Stock from Parents with Latent Tuberculosis.</i>
When a State is not pledged to exterminate tuberculosis by
prompt and radical measures, it is quite possible to raise healthy
stock from sires and dams that have the disease in a latent form.
It is very exceptional that calves are born tuberculous. If, then,
they are kept in a pure environment and furnished with the milk
of sound nurses, or even with the milk of their own tuberculous
dams, after it has been heated for one-quarter of an hour to 180°
F. or 212° F. they can be preserved in perfect health.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is especially adapted to herds of valuable thoroughbreds,
the destruction of which would be a serious loss, and the preservation
of the strain of blood a most desirable object.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole herd should be tested with tuberculin, and the advanced
and generalized cases, that can be detected by objective
symptoms, should be at once destroyed and safely disposed of.
The animals in good condition and that have not reacted should
be placed in a new barn and yard, or where no tubercle has been,
or in places that have been thoroughly disinfected, under special
attendants. There will remain the animals in good condition
with no objective symptom, but that have reacted, and these are
placed in separate barn, yard and pasture well away from other
stock, under their own attendants, for breeding purposes. They
should have the best of food and air, clean, well lighted, roomy
buildings with shelter from storms, clean sheltered yards, and in
summer, pasturage. Any cow showing indication of active advance
or generalization of the disease (cough, wheezing, dyspnœa
under exertion, excessive pallor of mucosæ, unthriftiness)
should be at once separated and destroyed as endangering the
reinfection of others, and the stable subjected to disinfection.
The calf, as soon as born, must be removed to a special building
or park, where it shall get milk from a sound cow or that of its
own dam after it has been carefully sterilized. After sterilization
the milk cannot safely be returned to the unscalded pail into
which it was drawn from the cow, and it should be fed by separate
attendants who have not milked nor handled the affected
animal. Any loss of condition, unthriftiness, cough or scouring
on the part of any of the calves should be the signal for its separation
from its fellows, subjection to the tuberculin test, and, if it
reacts, for its destruction and the disinfection of the building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>where it was. It is well to test each calf at six weeks old and to
remove the reacting ones. The success of this method is now
well established.</p>

<p class='c008'>Goodman, of Dorpat, applied it largely as early as 1891, rearing
the healthy calves of reacting cows on the milk of cows that
had stood the test. Bang, of Denmark, raised such calves to
sound maturity on sterilized milk. Reynolds, of Minnesota, reports
the raising of twenty-four healthy calves from infected cows
on the milk of tested cows, while three fed on milk of reacting
cows, which was supposed to be sterilized, all became tuberculous.
McEachran (1899) in an extended experiment succeeded
perfectly with the milk of tested cows only. I have now in hand
a Jersey herd in which the progeny, fed on the milk of their reacting
dams, became tuberculous without exception, and in the years
following, those fed on the milk of the same reacting cows after
it had been kept at 180° F. for half an hour all grew up healthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under this method, inasmuch as the infection is not at once extinguished,
but temporized with for the benefit of the stock
owner, State indemnities are not necessarily called for. Yet the
State can profitably test the cattle at public expense, mark indelibly
those that react, schedule them and control them, so that
they will not be allowed to change hands nor to mingle with
sound animals until finally butchered, dead or recovered. The
State should see to the thoroughness of the seclusion, disinfection,
the safe disposal of all products from milk to manure, and
the testing at intervals of three or six months of both cows and
calves.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Raising Healthy Offspring Without Sterilizing the Milk.</i> In
the northwest territories cows and heifers that have reacted to
tuberculin, but which otherwise appear to be in good health, are
made into a herd by themselves and placed on a special range
apart from all other cattle. They live in the open air, slight
shelter being allowed in winter only, and their calves are allowed
to suck the dams until winter. The wide range, the open air
life, and the early destruction by oxygen and sunshine of the discharged
bacilli, tend in the main to ward off infection, except such
as comes in the milk, and the majority of the calves grow up in
apparent health and are fattened for market. A small minority
are born tuberculous or contract the infection from the milk, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>this does not seriously impair the financial success, and living in
the open air they bring little danger to others. The loss is infinitesimal
as compared with the expense of milking a large
herd, sterilizing the milk and feeding it by hand. Advanced
cases, with objective symptoms, should always be removed, and
the cows may be tested at intervals if compatible with profit.
The seclusion of the herd should be complete, by distance, by the
configuration of the country, or by fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>For this system the climate of our Southern States, where stock
can remain out of doors all the year, offers a better field than the
semi-arctic northwest.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Removal of all Unthrifty Animals and Those Showing Physical
Symptoms of Tuberculosis.</i> Before the days of tuberculin testing
I succeeded in extinguishing tuberculosis in several herds by the
prompt removal of all unthrifty animals and such as showed
objective symptoms of tuberculosis, the disinfection of the buildings,
the restocking from sound herds, and the strict separation
of the new stock from the old. In one herd of 200 this entailed
the final destruction of the whole original herd; in others the
destruction was in the main limited to particular (susceptible)
families. But in these days, with the tuberculin test available, a
resort to a method of this kind would produce an unnecessarily
slow, uncertain and expensive result.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Removal of Animals Showing Objective Symptoms or Reaction
under Tuberculin.</i> The Bang (Danish) method is the chief example
of this, and is so considerate of both state outlay and
stock owner’s interests that it is deserving of high praise. Under
it the State usually waits for the stock owner to take the initiative,
but to encourage applications from the owners, it furnishes tuberculin
testing without expense, and even allows a small indemnity
for animals killed because of advanced tuberculosis. In return
for this the stock owner agrees to furnish separate buildings (or
enclosures), yards and pasturages, new or, when necessary, disinfected,
one set for the high conditioned, nonreacting, healthy
herd, and a second for the animals that reacted but which show
no further sign of tuberculosis, with separate attendants, utensils
and other appointments for each. This reacting herd is furnished
with the best of food, air, accommodation and hygiene generally,
and the milk is sterilized before it is allowed to pass into consumption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>by man or for calves or pigs or for the production of butter.
The quarantined herd is marked, registered, and kept under
government surveillance; it cannot be parted with for stock uses,
but it is at the disposal of the owner to keep it for milk, or fatten
at once for the butcher. Finally every member of this herd is
slaughtered under government inspection, and the beef put on
the market or sent to the rendering works as may be decided.
The system secures the hearty coöperation of dairyman, dealer
and government, and while it comes short of the speed and
efficiency of a generally applied method of extinction, it is accomplishing
a great work for Denmark, putting an immediate
stop to the advance of the disease in the worst infected herds,
and placing the latent cases of such herds in a safe seclusion for
the rest of their lives. At first the tested herds showed 40 per
cent. affected; now less than 20 per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The feature which would be likely to work the least satisfactorily
in the United States, is the disposal of the sterilized milk as such.
It is to be feared that this milk would find but a poor market with
us, and if it proved unsalable, the preservation of the reacting
herd would be no longer an economic success.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Pennsylvania where practically the same method is in force,
leaving it in the option of the owner to keep the reacting latent
cases and sterilize their milk, or to abandon them to the State,
have them appraised and slaughtered with indemnity, the uniform
practice has been to accept the latter alternative. Not a single
owner, I believe, has elected to keep a herd in quarantine and
sell the milk sterilized. The result has been that four times the
number of applications come in that the appropriation will warrant
the officials to take in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>A special feature of the Pennsylvania method is the provision
that a stockowner can have his herd examined, and tested with
tuberculin, at his expense, the State to furnish a certificate setting
forth the condition of the animals. In case of infection, the
owner has the option of abandoning the reacting ones to the State,
to be secluded, or appraised and slaughtered, he meanwhile
guaranteeing that he shall introduce no new animals into the
herd except by tuberculin test under the direction of the State
Board.</p>

<p class='c008'>The usual provision is in force that no indemnity is allowed for
any animal that entered the state not more than three months
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>before, and without the tuberculin test demanded of all such stock
animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indemnities are restricted to $25 per head and under for non-registered
animals and grades, and $50 for registered thoroughbreds.
The average appraised price has been $23.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the whole an excellent work is being done in Pennsylvania,
and herds now tested are found to contain not more than half as
many infected animals as did those tested a few years ago. A
better showing would doubtless have been made if the State appropriation
had permitted the board to give attention to all applications
made.</p>

<p class='c008'>The good results may be attributed to the adoption of a system
which secured the confidence and trust of the stockowner: he
sees that the State has no desire to oppress nor injure him; he is
in no dread of a high-handed confiscation of his remunerative
property without indemnity; while advanced cases are destroyed
he is left the option of segregating his latent cases and marketing
their products under the precaution of sterilization; he can raise
the progeny of these animals if he will, under similar precautions;
he can sell his stock and its product under government certificate
if they prove sound; he can avail of government assistance in
protecting his herd against reinfection, by the testing of animals
to be purchased. Under such a system there is no object in secreting
infection, and in underhanded sale of tuberculous animals,
with the spread of the disease into new centres. Even the tardy
or inimical stockowner is roused to action by public opinion, when
he finds the market for his suspected product growing more and
more uncertain, and feels the daily encreasing pressure of opinion
among neighboring owners, that he is exceeding his rights in
maintaining an infected herd in the very midst of their purified
ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>A most important item of the system of Pennsylvania, and of
sixteen other states, is the compulsory testing of all stock cattle
introduced into the State. This has the further support of the
Federal Government which demands a tuberculin test of every
stock bovine animal imported into the United States. This is a
natural corollary of every attempt to restrict or extirpate tuberculosis
from a State, but when through willful blindness a great
State like New York, repudiates a measure of this kind, it but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>makes its dairy and breeding herds the depository of the reacting
animals that other states wisely exclude. The sifting process
goes on at Buffalo and other centres and the New York herds are
loaded with the rejected, diseased animals. Under the operation
of this, and the denial of indemnity for animals slaughtered, it
will be wonderful, if the New York stock owner is not soon
roused up from his idle dream of fancied security, by a great extension
of the infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Generally Applicable Measures.</i> Under any system many
special rules will be demanded in individual cases, which it will
require the skill of the expert sanitarian to apply, and which
cannot be referred to here. The following are generally applicable
whether by the owner in his particular herd, or by the State or
other authority dealing with the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>1st. On discovery of a case of tuberculosis, test the whole herd
with tuberculin. (See Tuberculin Testing.)</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. Remove all animals that show a typical reaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d. Destroy and burn, boil or deeply bury all cases of the disease,
unless it is decided to form an isolated herd of latent cases
which are in good condition and apparent good health.</p>

<p class='c008'>4th. In case of doubt or disturbing influence which may have
caused rise of temperature (calving, heat, exposure, concurrent
disease, changes in management, etc.), keep the suspected animal
apart for four weeks and test again.</p>

<p class='c008'>5th. Repeat the test every six months, and if two successive
tests show no indication of tuberculosis, the herd may be accounted
sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>6th. As soon as tuberculous animals have been removed from
a stable, let it be vacated and thoroughly disinfected with chloride
of lime, 4 ozs. to 1 gallon of water, and enough quick lime to
make a good whitewash which will show if even a square inch is
missed. When chloride of lime is objectionable because of its
tainting the milk, use mercuric chloride 1 dr. to 1 gallon water,
with enough sal ammoniac to make it freely soluble. The roof,
walls, and especially the floor, gutter and feeding trough must be
first thoroughly scraped, washed and cleaned, all rotten wood
work must be removed, and, in case of double boarded walls, the
boards must be removed on one side to permit of a thorough application.
Utensils should be scalded and dressed with carbolic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>acid, 1:20. A stable incapable of disinfection should be abandoned
for a length of time or burned.</p>

<p class='c008'>7th. In making new purchases, avoid any herd in which tuberculosis
has appeared, or that has had sickness or deaths in recent
years.</p>

<p class='c008'>8th. Do not purchase from city, suburban nor swill stables.</p>

<p class='c008'>9th. Do not take a cow that is in ill health or low condition,
especially one with cough, nasal discharge, foul breath, wheezing
breathing, hard nodules under the skin, diseased udder, swollen
bones or joints, or a tendency to scour or bloat.</p>

<p class='c008'>10th. Test every animal with tuberculin before admitting it
into the herd.</p>

<p class='c008'>11th. Do not admit strange cattle to house, field or yard. Keep
apart from the herd until tested.</p>

<p class='c008'>12th. Keep each animal strictly to its own stall and manger.</p>

<p class='c008'>13th. Board up between the stalls in front so that no two cows
can feed from the same manger.</p>

<p class='c008'>14th. Be especially watchful of the older cows and on the
slightest sign of ill health, separate and subject to the tuberculin
test.</p>

<p class='c008'>15th. In case a herd of cattle is found to be tuberculous, subject
to the tuberculin test all domestic animals that have mingled
with them freely and fed from the same troughs. Remove those
that show a reaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>16th. Exterminate the vermin (rats, mice, sparrows) in a
building where tuberculosis has prevailed.</p>

<p class='c008'>17th. Let no consumptive person attend on cattle nor prepare
their food.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HYGIENE OF MILK AND MEAT. SANITARY POLICE MEASURES.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This has a reference to both man and beast and involves measures
of private and public hygiene alike. In man, as we have
seen, milk is the source of greatest danger, being habitually
taken uncooked, whereas meat has been usually subjected to a
high temperature before it comes to the table.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Milk.</i> The unsterilized milk of the tuberculous cow must
always be regarded with grave suspicion. Especially is the drinking
of milk warm from the cow to be strongly condemned. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>feeding experiments of Vilemin, Gerlach and others, in 1866 to
1869, demonstrated the virulence on the lower animals of the milk
of infected cows, and many accidental infections have shown the
same for man. (See relation of the bacillus of man to that of
animals). This conceded, the question arose as to the virulence
of milk drawn from the sound udders of tuberculous cows.
Many experiments of Nocard, Galtier, McFadyean and others
seemed to decide against such infection. Others have had a different
experience, and especially when the test was made by inoculation.
Ernst found tubercle in 30 per cent. of the cows he
examined, though no affection of the udder could be made out.
Theobald Smith, Hirschberger, Bang and others found tubercle
bacilli in milk from sound udders. Pearson, injecting the milk from
sound udders intraperitoneally into Guinea pigs had ten in sixty-three
affected. Rabinowitsch and Kemper found tubercle bacilli
in ten out of fifteen cows with sound udders. While it must be
allowed that often a very small proportion of tuberculous cows
with sound udders pass the bacilli in the milk yet a sufficient
number of exceptions are found to deter one from endorsing such
milk as safe. Much more is this conclusion justified by the consideration
that commencing mammary tuberculosis is in many
cases unrecognizable by ordinary examination intravitam or post
mortem. Again when the bacilli are circulating in the blood
(generalized tuberculosis) they can escape from such a vascular
tissue as the mamma without the formation of a local lesion, as
they can pass through the intestinal walls or lungs and colonize
the adjacent lymph glands. Nocard’s injections of the bacilli
into the veins seem to show that they disappear from the blood in
4 to 6 days, but with a generalization of the infection from within,
the presumption is against a single isolated entrance of bacilli,
and in favor of a continuous introduction. In such generalization
therefore the bacilli circulate in all vascular tissues, and are
liable to escape with any normal secretion, but especially with the
milk or urine on account of the great vascularity of the glands.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the udder is itself tuberculous the case is incomparably
worse. The milk can scarcely fail to be infecting, and the bacilli,
grown in these highly vascular tissues, apart from the air, are
usually of a very virulent type. Of these Martin writes in the
report of the Royal Commission (England): “The milk of cows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>with tuberculosis of the udder possesses a virulence which can
only be described as extraordinary. All animals inoculated
showed tuberculosis in its most rapid form.” Woodhead is
equally positive in this position. Galtier says “we should absolutely
avoid the consumption of milk from cows in which the
udder is tuberculous, and boil before using, the milk of all
cows affected with, or suspected of tuberculosis in any form.”
Finally we should never consume without boiling, milk of which
we do not certainly know the origin, and especially in cities, we
ought not to omit this precaution in the case of milk furnished
by milkmen.” Rabinowitsch and Kemper add: “Milk from
cows that react to tuberculin must be suspected of being tuberculous
in every case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It may well be allowed that the mixed milk from a large dairy,
containing but one or two tuberculous cows, is much less infecting
than that of the tubercular cow herself, and that skim milk that
has been passed through the separator has been robbed of many
bacilli which have been precipitated in the albuminoid material
that collects on the inner side of the bowl. But these mean dilution
not purification: they reduce the danger but do not altogether
remove it, and sanitary police should aim at sterilization in every
case where available.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Butter</i>, <i>cheese</i>, <i>whey</i>, and other dairy products have been proved
virulent in different cases (Galtier, Heim, Lasar, Bang, Obermüller,
Roth, Groëning, Gasperimi, Petri, Rabinowitsch). This
was true for butter 120 days old, and cheese 330 days. In a
number of cases Rabinowitsch found a bacillus, similar to the
tubercle bacillus and producing tubercle-like lesions, but differing
in its staining, morphology and culture, and she supposed that
other observers had mistaken this for the tubercle bacillus. Petri,
Morgenroth and Hormann, found the bacillus of Rabinowitsch in
company with the real tubercle bacillus in butter, and Rabinowitsch,
later, in fifteen samples of butter found the bacillus tuberculosis
in two.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bacilli coming from the mouth, bowels, or lungs, are also liable
to get into the milk, through the floating dust of the stable, or
from the teats, udder, tail, etc., (Gaffky).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Oleomargarine</i> cannot be considered as free from this indictment,
for though the tuberculous glands, etc., from the mesentery, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>be sterilized in the preliminary heating process, yet the subsequent
mixing with milk is liable to convey the infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ideal course with milk, if the herds cannot be purified
from tuberculosis, would be to compulsorily remove from the
herd every cow that shows objective symptoms of tuberculosis,
or any internal disease of the udder, and to subject all the milk
of the remainder to Pasteurization at a temperature of 155° F.
for twenty to thirty minutes. This, however, requires skilled
and faithful management to avoid renewed contamination from
the lips of the vessel which may have escaped the heat, or from
hands, vessels and objects that were in contact with the milk before.
The boiling temperature for fifteen minutes would be a
safer resort, as requiring less careful handling, yet even this may
be contaminated afterward under poor management. It has the
further drawback of the boiled milk taste and the coagulation of
the albumen. But the outlay for such careful sterilization will
soon amount to more than will the tuberculin test.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Meat.</i> For various reasons meat must be held less virulent
than milk, but mainly because it is less frequently the seat of
tubercle than the udder, and because it is usually cooked before
being eaten. The muscular tissue of the ox appears to be unfavorable
to colonization by the bacillus, and although the intermuscular
lymph glands do not partake of this inherent resistance,
yet as the glands are very frequently affected from the tissues
which they drain, they necessarily partake in some degree of the
comparative immunity of the muscles. This immunity is, however,
far from complete, as the frequent implication of the intermuscular
glands (prescapular, axillary, prefemoral, etc.), sufficiently
show. Again in estimating the virulence of meat we
must never forget that in the great majority of cases, in ordinary
infected herds, the tubercle is still essentially local; no generalization
has taken place. The muscle is vascular throughout, and
in cases of generalized tuberculosis is infecting, yet a single
transient escape of tubercle bacilli into the blood does not ensure
permanent infection of that fluid, which can usually purify itself
in six days or less (Nocard). On the contrary, when the escape
of bacilli into the blood is constant, so becomes of necessity the
virulence of the blood and a rapid generalization ensues. Such
continuous escape may occur in actively advancing tuberculosis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>at any point, but it is more certain if the degenerating tubercle
has opened through the walls of the vessels (capillaries), so that
the infecting bacilli can pass into the blood in a continuous
stream. The pus and other microbes, in complex infections,
hasten this degeneration and contribute to generalization of the
tubercle and emaciation. The transient infection of the blood
with the pure tubercle bacillus does not, however, lead to emaciation
and marasmus, and hence the frequency of high condition in
spite of extensive tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ostertag gives the following as indicating blood infection:
“When with emaciation there is evidence of recent blood infection,
enlargement of spleen and all lymph glands, miliary
tubercles of the lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys.” In the
absence of these indications, though there may be numerous old standing
tubercles, caseated, calcified or sclerosed, he considers
that there is no reason to dread infection of the blood and carcass.
Even a tuberculous intermuscular gland does not, in his opinion,
condemn the adjacent muscle. When vomicæ (caverns) are
present in the lungs and internal organs the flesh may still be
used “if embolic tubercles of different ages, indicating repeated
eruptions of tubercle bacilli into the blood stream are absent from
the spleen and kidneys.” This meat is, however, to be sterilized
before marketing (Ostertag).</p>

<p class='c008'>The United States Bureau of Animal Industry orders the destruction
of all cases of “extensive or generalized tuberculosis;”
“any disease or injury causing elevation of temperature or affecting
the system of the animal to a degree which would make the
flesh unfit for human food;” also “any organ or part of a carcass
which is&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* affected by tuberculosis&#160;*&#160;*.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In most countries of Europe even emaciated animals are used
for food for animals or even man, provided the wasting is not too
extreme. The carcass must, however, first be subjected to a
temperature of 230° F. for a period of three hours. This is sold
in a special market as low priced meat and labelled as such.
Ordinary cooking does not always sterilize, as Martin and Woodhead,
like Vilemin, found living bacilli in the centre of a cooked
six-pound roast.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>TREMBLING IN SHEEP. LOUPING-ILL. INFECTIVE MYELO-MENINGITIS. IXODIC TOXÆMIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Definition: infective, tick-borne disease, characterized by meningo-myelitis.
Animals susceptible: sheep, and possibly swine (Meek, Greig-Smith)
and cattle (Williams). Known in North Britain only in spring (in Skye
also in autumn), on rough pasture with much brush, and wood ticks,
(Ixodes ricinus, erinaceous, marginatus or other). Experimental infection.
Bacteriology: Bacterium fluorescens β and γ found in exudate and infecting.
Accessory causes: dried grass of previous year, brush, low condition,
cold, youth. Symptoms: incubation 10 to 30 days; impaired innervation,
hyperæsthesia, timidity, excitability, trembling, jerking, lack of coördination
and balance, falling, convulsive struggling, jumping, rolling of eyes,
stiffness, opisthotonos, paresis, paralysis of hind—later of fore limbs, apathy.
Wry neck, arched back, stiff joints. Diagnosis from <i>myelo-meningitis</i> by
its enzoötic appearance, in spring, on tick infested ground: from <i>paralytic
rabies</i>, also by absence of that disease locally; from <i>tetanus</i> by its general
prevalence, the absence of tonic spasm, and presence of palsy; from <i>braxy</i>
by the lack of emphysematous swellings, and of speedy sepsis; from <i>anthrax</i>
by usually healthy spleen and its confinement to sheep. Lesions:
cerebral meningitis with encrease of subarachnoid fluid, of myelon, reddened,
softened, also of other serosæ, stomach, bowels, liver and kidneys.
Prevention: destroy ticks in winter by burning grass and brush, by ploughing
and cropping; or fence off ½ the pasture one year and the other half
next; or lime soil; or dip repeatedly in April, May and June to keep off
ticks; avoid moving sheep in these months: Give liberal feeding. Mortality
10 to 20 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> All infective disease of sheep, inoculated by ticks,
and producing a meningo-myelitis, with drowsiness, hyperæsthesia,
irritability, paresis and other nervous disorders.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> This is almost exclusively a disease of
sheep, yet Meek and Greig-Smith claim to have seen it in swine
that have eaten the raw carcasses of <i>louping-ill</i> sheep, or that
have ranged the tick infested pastures, and in rabbits inoculated
with the microbe from the wound caused by the tick. W. Williams
claims to have seen well marked cases in cattle, and heard
of cases in horses and swine. He speaks, however, rather obscurely
of “<i>the tick disease</i>” and seemingly includes in this all
affections inoculated by ticks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> This disease has been hitherto described
as existing in the northern part of Great Britain only,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>but given the presence of the tick, and of the infection which it
carries and the malady might easily be extended indefinitely. It
is known to prevail in Northumberland north of the Tyne, in
Kirkcudbright, Dumfries, Ayrshire, Lanark, Peebles, Roxburgh,
Berwick, Argyle, Inverness, and Ross. In Berwick it is less
prevalent than in the other countries named, while in the
Western Isles it is not only widely spread rising on the hills 2000
feet or as high as the sheep range, but in Skye there are two distinct
outbreaks, in spring and autumn respectively, apparently
coinciding with the appearance of two successive generations of
ticks. This may be due to the prevalence of warm winds from
the Gulf Stream. Further investigation will doubtless show a
much wider distribution—the author has seen an affection bearing
the same general characters on the spurs of the Lammermoors in
East Lothian, and the supposed adaptation of the Norse word
<i>hloupa</i> (staggering) suggests that it is probably not unknown in
Scandinavia. W. Williams notes its prevalence on the Silurian
formation, but ticks confine themselves to no geologic stratum,
and the tick is the main agent in carrying infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes. 1st, Sheep Ticks.</i> The sheep tick is not the <i>ked</i>
(Melophagus ovinus) which is common on long wooled sheep
everywhere and is an example of a wingless, degraded dipterous
insect.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sheep ticks, on the other hand, are true ixodes, and of the
same family with our common wood tick and of the cattle tick
(boöphilus bovis) of the Southern States and the West Indies.
The ticks collected from the sheep by W. Williams were identified
by Mr. Moore, of the British Museum, as ixodes ricinus, ixodes
erinaceous and ixodes marginatus. Those obtained by Meek and
Greig-Smith showed the following characters: The male is 2.48
mm. long, by 1.30 mm. broad; the female is 5 to 5.5 mm. long,
by 3 mm. broad, or when gorged with blood, 10 mm. long, by
7 mm. broad. The fasting female is yellowish green, and when
full of blood, blue. Following the rule of their genus, the mature
tick has eight legs, the larva but six. The fasting larva has
head, legs and dorsal plate (scutellum) brown, the remainder of
the body yellow. Scattered hairs appear on the body, legs and
maxillæ.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all ticks the rostrum is a characteristic feature. It consists
centrally and interiorly of a dart covered below and on each side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>by rows of teeth turned backward, which, when imbedded in the
skin, hold so firmly that the parasite may be pulled in two in any
attempt to pull it out. Above this dart and on the two sides lie
the cheliferæ (horns), each furnished with three or four teeth
turned outwardly and more or less recurved, by which the dart is
worked into the skin. Finally, on the lateral sides of this central
apparatus, are the two maxillary palpi, which are not inserted
into the skin, but applied against it and operate as feelers prior to
and during the insertion of the dart and cheliferæ. The maxillary
palpi are club-shaped and soft.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ticks pass through three moultings before they attain to the
sexually mature eight-legged form, and though the hexapod
larvæ attach themselves to animals and irritate the skin by their
bites, it is only the mature, impregnated egg-bearing female that
lives exclusively on blood and sucks this to excess.</p>

<p class='c008'>While given species of ticks show a preference for particular
genera of animals, yet ticks generally in their vagabond life will
leave the long grass and brush where they have been hatched to
become temporarily the guests of any passing animal. It is,
therefore, premature to seek to identify any single species of tick
as the only bearer of the infection, and it is quite possible that
any one of several species may contribute to its propagation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Experimental Infection by the Tick.</i> W. Williams muzzled
four sheep from a healthy district and turned them for several
hours a day on a tick-infested field, and two sickened—one on the
eighth day and one on the sixteenth. Twelve ticks sent out of
the district and put on a healthy sheep caused illness on the tenth
day. In a second experiment with ten sheep, during a colder
spring, when there were fewer ticks, no deaths occurred.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meek and Greig-Smith turned twenty sheep on a tick-infested
louping-ill pasture, six of the number wearing muzzles to prevent
grazing, seven having been dressed with a mixture of sweet oil,
2 quarts; castor oil, 1 quart; train oil, 1 quart; pitch oil, 3 gills,
and cade oil, 1 gill, while the remaining seven were unmuzzled
and undressed. The muzzled sheep were regularly taken out
and fed on food from a healthy locality. At the end of a fortnight
oils were reapplied on the second lot (seven sheep). No
ticks appeared on these sheep, while many were found on the
undressed ones. On the fifteenth one of the unmuzzled and untreated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>sheep sickened and died with lesions of louping-ill. On
the twenty-second day one of the muzzled sheep sickened, and
died of louping-ill next morning. On the thirty-first day another
of the muzzled sheep took ill and on the thirty-eighth was killed.
It showed characteristic symptoms and lesions. The seven salved
sheep, on which no ticks could at any time be found, remained
healthy throughout.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> W. Williams describes a bacillus which he
figures as forming filaments of very uneven breadth, with frequent
branching (contrary to the habit of bacilli), and forming
spores in clusters. These were obtained from the coagulum of
the cerebro-spinal fluid and Meek and Greig-Smith conclude that
the alleged mycelium was but the filaments of fibrin.</p>

<p class='c008'>McFadyean found pus microbes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meek and Greig-Smith (Veterinarian, 1896–7) found in the
black bloody swellings under the skin, where the ticks had
inserted their proboscides, a variety of microbes which in pure
cultures did not provoke louping-ill. These included staphylococcus
cereus albus, sarcina lutea, bacterium putridum, bacterium
coli commune, micrococcus sulphurous, micrococcus bicolor, and
micrococcus caudicans. He also found penicillium glaucum.
Two organisms allied to the bacterium fluorescens and designated
as β and γ (G) respectively, were found in these sores and produced
in rabbits and sheep nervous disorders and lesions which
could be fairly identified with louping-ill. These are about 1.5
to 1.7μ long by 0.7μ broad, and chromogenic with a special fluorescent
appearance. Microbe β inoculated on a rabbit caused on
the second day rhythmic movements of the head downward and
to one side, the eyelids closing as the head dropped, as if the
animal were constantly falling asleep. In another rabbit it caused
stiffness of the legs only and in a third it had no effect. Microbe
γ when cultivated ærobically was harmless to rabbits, but when
grown anærobically on mutton bouillon to which a drop of blood
had been added, it caused on the second day general paralysis of
the neck and limbs, spasmodic twitching of the muscles, dyspnœa
and feeble heart action. Two rabbits which survived the early
effects developed large axillary and inguinal abscesses four
months later.</p>

<p class='c008'>A lamb inoculated with the bouillon culture of γ showed after
thirteen days, lameness of one hind limb, with paresis, and a disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>to fall to one side or the other. Two months later, when
it had greatly improved, a second inoculation of microbe γ grown
anærobically in bouillon and blood, caused, on the third day, a
severe aggravation of the lameness.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> Much depends on the abundance of old dried
grasses of the previous year in which the larval ticks may
hibernate. Land that has been burnt over in winter, that is
cleared of brush, or in which the aftermath has been killed by
free salting or liming will be largely cleared of the ticks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever disturbs or undermines the general health lays the
system open to the disease and many flockmasters in tick-infested
districts have succeeded in greatly reducing the mortality by
feeding sound hay and oats in winter. Sudden changes of
weather have long been noticed to coincide with outbreaks of the
disease. A change to cold and wet is especially dangerous as
causing a chill and robbing the system of its tone and vigor. But
a sudden access of warm spring weather, especially if at the same
time moist, may have a decidedly predisposing effect by lowering
the general tone. A fatal paresis common in the flocks of New
York, in the absence of ticks, shows a similar tendency to select
the atonic animal. This occurs mainly in spring, when the sheep
have been shut up in close confinement for weeks or months, with
flaccid muscles and fatty livers, and above all if they are in
advanced pregnancy with twin lambs, and if their fleeces are extra
heavy. In both affections the majority of the flock escape, while
those that are specially predisposed succumb. Lambs suffer most,
doubtless because of relative weakness, and on account of their
innate and unexhausted susceptibility.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> After an incubation varying from ten days to thirty
some impairment or disorder of the innervation is shown, varying
widely, however, in different cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two names “trembling” and “louping-ill” long used by
shepherds as characteristic of the disease indicate spasmodic disorder
of a clonic kind, the paresis which is essentially passive
having been very naturally overlooked, or held to be subordinate.
There is hyperthermia the temperature rising at times to 105° or
higher, and often marked hyperæsthesia and excitability at the
outset. On approaching the patient it is very much frightened,
and when caught, struggles and twitches in a remarkable manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>or trembles violently. If merely raised or disturbed the trembling
or clonic spasms are very marked, the nose is jerked forward and
upward from the contraction of the muscles attached to the occiput;
the legs may be lifted jerkingly as in stringhalt; when
raised they are moved stiffly or sway uncertainly before the foot
is once more planted; or the sheep loses its balance, falls to the
ground and struggles convulsively in its efforts to get up and
escape. As the result, it will in certain cases jump to its
feet, rising meanwhile to an undue height in the air. In other
cases there is squinting or rolling of the eyes, and movements of
the jaws with frothing from the mouth. Or the spasms may be
tonic affecting especially the muscles of the back and loins, and
causing extreme stiffness or rigidity or even opisthotonos. Lambs
are unable to suck.</p>

<p class='c008'>But whether the early spastic symptoms are well marked or
not, paresis and even paralysis set in sooner or later. This usually
begins as paraplegia, or exceptionally one limb only may be
affected at first, causing the animal to walk on three legs. For a
time the fore limbs may be free, and the patient attempts to move
by dragging the hind limbs, which are extended backward.
When the fore limbs become involved the animal remains down
helpless and after awhile apathetic. Temperature and sensibility
are both greatly lowered in the paralyzed limbs. Sometimes the
spasms are lateral and the head may be drawn to one side.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the animals that survive the early attack, there is likely to
remain some lasting deformity, such as wry neck, arched back,
stiff or swollen joints. Abscesses, which appeared in the inoculated
rabbits after a lapse of four months, are a not uncommon
sequel in sheep, the pus collecting in the neighborhood of a joint,
or of the lymph glands of the axilla, inguinal region, breast or
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>The succession of symptoms are in the main such as are observed
in other cases of myelo-meningitis, first exalted function
and later depressed and abolished.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> From other forms of myelo-meningitis it may be
distinguished by its enzoötic occurrence on tick-infested pastures,
which already have a reputation for causing this malady, by its
appearance only in the season of the development of the tick, by
the presence of the tick or of its sores on the skin, and by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>entire absence from adjacent fields which are free from ticks.
From paralytic rabies it is differentiated by the same conditions,
and as a rule by the absence of rabies from the district and of
any evidence of a bite. In tetanus the tonic persistent nature of
the spasms, the absence of paralysis, the marked spasms of the
muscles of the eye, and the usually isolated condition of the case
should prevent any confusion. Braxy is to be distinguished by
its emphysematous swellings near the surface of the body, and
by the comparative absence of hyperæsthesia, spasm, or paralysis.
The carcass in braxy undergoes much more rapid decomposition.
Anthrax is more rapidly fatal, shows no such marked nervous
disorder, has a dark, nonoxygenated and often incoagulable blood,
an enlarged sanguineous spleen, and the characteristic anthrax
bacilli. It attacks the larger herbivora as readily as the small.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The most constant and striking lesions are found in
the nerve centres. In many cases there have been found cerebral
meningitis, involving the choroid plexus (Fair, Hamilton, Klein,
Murray, McFadyean) with an encrease of the ventricular and
subarachnoid fluid (Murray, Hamilton, Williams). The exudate
may be yellow or rosy from contained blood globules (Klein).
The meninges are thickened and the seat of ramified redness.
In the region of the spine inflammation is found not only in the
meninges but also in the cord, which may be blood-stained, softened
(Mathewson, Goodwin, Robertson), or in older cases indurated
(Robertson, Hamilton, Williams, Young). In this last
condition there is a sclerotic condition of the neuroglia, and it
may be a distinct atrophy. The exudate is usually abundant
and more or less coagulated into a soft, diffluent jelly.</p>

<p class='c008'>In many cases there is inflammation of the serous membranes
of the chest (pleura, pericardium, endocardium), and even of the
lungs (Fair, Hamilton, Klein). In some instances there has
been inflammation of the stomach and intestines (McFadyean),
liver and kidneys (Klein), and enlargement of the spleen has
been noted. The most constant lesions appear to be those of the
nerve centres, but the wide variety of organs involved in different
cases sufficiently accounts for the variability of symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> As the ticks are the chief media of infection, the
disease may be eradicated by their destruction. The burning of
all withered grass and brush during the winter months will do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>much in this direction. Their destruction is rendered even more
complete by ploughing and putting the land under a series of
cultivated crops. By this means not only is the winter shelter of
the tick removed, but the animal host which it requires for its
complete development is denied it, and it must perish before the
land is again seeded to grass. When the land is unsuited to cultivation,
the same end may be in some measure secured by fencing
off half the pasture, and leaving it unpastured for a season,
meanwhile burning the dry grass or temporarily suppressing it
by a liberal application of salt. The following year the pasture
so treated may be restored to pasturage, and the other half subjected
to the same course of treatment. In the absence of such
thorough treatment, a liberal application of lime to a virgin soil
will often bring a growth so fresh and appetizing that the stock
keeps it closely cropped and thus removes the shelter for the offensive
ticks. Finally, the ticks may be prevented from attacking
the animals, by repeated use during April, May and June of a
dip in which tar oil, cade oil, heavy petroleum or other odorous
insecticide forms a component part (see the dip of Meek and
Greig-Smith).</p>

<p class='c008'>A very obvious precaution is to avoid the movement of sheep
during April, May and June, from tick-infested pastures to others
which furnish rank grass, brush or other suitable shelter for the
preservation of the parasite.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been noticed that sheep indigenous to the tick-infested
and louping-ill pastures are less susceptible than those that have
been introduced from outside, but, as yet, no attempt appears to
have been made to secure immunity by the use of sterilized
products of the microbe, nor therapy by the resort to antitoxin.
A liberal and tonic diet is an important element in prevention.
Grain and hay should therefore be allowed whenever necessary
to bring the sheep to early summer in good condition.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> can hardly be said to have been attempted, though
mild cases are allowed by the shepherds to recover. According
to Meek, the deaths often average 10 to 20 per cent. of the flock.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> An acute infectious disease of sheep, manifested
by sudden attack, colicy pains, inflammatory and sero-hæmorrhagic
lesions of the bowels, and sanguino-emphysematous swellings
occurring subcutaneously and especially in the hind quarters.
The blood is dark, tarry and comparatively incoagulable and after
death putrefaction advances with extraordinary rapidity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> Braxy is generally prevalent in
Iceland where it was described over a century ago (1778) by
Ketilson as “vinstrarfár” or “vinstrarplága” (“Omasum
disease”). In Norway it prevails on the whole Atlantic border
to as far north apparently as the sheep industry extends (Stavanger
to Tromso Amt). The Faroe Islands are said to be
affected throughout. In Scotland it prevails like louping-ill along
the west coast especially, and embraces Caithness, Ross, Cromarty,
Banff, Inverness, Aberdeen, Argyle, Bute, Ayrshire, Lanark,
Galloway, Dumfries, Peebles, Selkirk and Roxburgh.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span><i>Causes.</i> Like louping-ill this affection is associated with inclement
seasons, exposed localities, and insufficient or indigestible
food, but it differs in being an affection of autumn and winter
rather than spring. It is rarely seen in summer. At a time
when it was looked upon as an acute indigestion, its coincidence
with hard frost or deep snow, was explained on the basis that the
victim had been driven to eat dry, fibrous, indigestible grasses,
brakens and heather. W. Williams who formerly identified the
disease with anthrax, seemed to go back to this theory of indigestion.
Though that is no longer tenable, yet it would be wrong
to ignore the effect of inclement weather and unwholesome food
in predisposing the animal system, and robbing it of the healthy
tone which would otherwise have successfully resisted the infection
in many cases. The occurrence of deaths after frosty mornings
more than during mild weather, suggests at once the chill
effected in the animal, the chilling of the paunch by the frosted
grass eaten producing a subsequent congestive reaction, and the
known facility with which frozen vegetables undergo rapid fermentation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cowan and Borthwick, (Transactions of Highland Society
1863) agree that the disease is especially prevalent when the
land has been overstocked in summer, or when there has been a
drought which withered up the pastures, and later a free growth
of green herbage from the autumn rains. This they attribute to
the “foul and unwholesome” character of the autumn growth,
but it suggests no less the low condition of the sheep on the overstocked
lands and the soft, aqueous character of the herbage
grown rapidly in a comparatively cold season. Cowan quotes
cases in which the lambs, weaned early and put in a separate
pasture (hogg hirsel), suffered a mortality of 50 per cent., while
in later years when allowed to remain with the ewes until winter,
the deaths were reduced to 10 or 15 per cent. Here the more
rugged health and vigor were manifestly strong prophylactic
factors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both Cowan and Borthwick incriminate the withered heather
and the dry, fibrous (“tathy”) and innutritious tufts of grass
which make up a large proportion of many hill pastures in
autumn and winter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cowan strongly condemns heavy smearing with tar, which he
believes to encrease the mortality, by lowering the general tone of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>the system: “Hoggs are very dull and listless for some time after
being smeared with tar, more especially if heavily smeared;&#160;...
when the skin is taken off, every shed or opening in the
wool where the tar has been laid on, is as distinctly visible upon
the flesh as the stripes upon a piece of printed calico.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been further alleged that the deaths are especially common
during the full of the moon, the usual explanation being
that the sheep are tempted to feed in the night and overload the
stomach. It may be added that at such times the grass is taken
in a cold—(often frosted) condition so as to chill the stomach
and cause a congestive reaction, and that short of this, under the
night dews the microbian ferments are moist and ready to start
into full activity, while the herbage if it has been partly frosted
is particularly susceptible to bacteridian attack.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology of Braxy.</i> The essential cause of braxy was revealed
by Ivar Nielson in 1888, who demonstrated on the local
lesions of the alimentary canal and the capillaries of various internal
organs a bacillus which he named <i>bacillus gastromycosis
ovis</i>. This is 2 to 6μ long by 1μ broad, occurring in pairs or filaments.
The organism has an elliptical form and stains deeply at
the extremities, while the central, bulging portion fails to take
the color, is highly refrangent, and represents the spore. The
non-spore-bearing bacilli are long, uniform rods with rounded
ends. The germ is anærobic, grows readily in serum glycerine
agar, and is gas producing and foul smelling. Liquefies gelatine.
It is found abundantly in the congested parts of the abomasum
and to a less extent in the bowels, in the mucosa, and in the submucous
and subserous tissues. It was also found in the
blood and in the small areas of degeneration in the liver and kidneys.
Jensen obtained pure cultures through the survival of the
spores when impure cultures were boiled for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals Susceptible.</i> Inoculation of the cultures subcutem
produces an affection resembling malignant œdema, or braxy, in
sheep, Guinea pigs, mice, pigeons and hens, and less certainly in
rabbits. Inoculation of a calf had no deleterious effect, while a
second succumbed in forty-eight hours. In its pathogenesis this
microbe appears to be more closely allied to that of malignant
œdema than that of black quarter, as the latter attacks cattle
very readily and has little effect on rabbits, pigeons and chickens.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span><i>Symptoms.</i> The more obvious manifestations of braxy bear a
resemblance to those of black quarter, so that the two affections
have been often confounded. In both the attack is sudden, the
course rapid and fatal, the back arched, the step short, especially
with the hind limbs, and there are swellings which crepitate on
pressure on the hind quarters or some other part of the body.
Symptoms of colic soon appear, the sheep lying down and rising
frequently and moving the hind limbs uneasily, and the abdomen
becomes distended, tympanitic and tender. Rumination and
feeding are promptly suspended, and as a rule defecation as well.
Urine may be passed frequently in small amounts and of a high
color. The pulse is rapid and often irregular and the breathing
hurried and labored. In some cases the abdominal pain is less
acute, the animal standing apart with drooping head, ears and
eyelids and frothy lips, or lying by itself at a distance from the
flock. Sooner or later emphysematous swellings appear on some
part of the body, but most commonly on the hind quarter, which
have a soft, doughy feeling and crackle or gurgle on pressure.
In the great majority of cases, however, the disease runs a rapid
course and ends in death in a few hours, and as the attacks are
mostly in the cold of the night, the victim, which appeared well
at night, is found dead in the morning. Cowan has often noticed
that those that stepped short at night were dead next morning.
In certain cases the sheep stood obstinately to the end and fell
dead as if shot. When death was deferred for several days a
common result was shedding of the wool.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathological Anatomy.</i> A marked feature of braxy is the early
putrefaction of the carcass. The rigor mortis quickly passes and
the carcass bloats up and exhales a putrid odor. On removing
the skin one sees extensive sero-sanguineous exudations, mixed
with bubbles of gas of an offensive odor. The abdomen is tense
and tympanitic and the anus protrudes. Visceral lesions are
especially marked in the fourth stomach, the walls of which are
thickened in patches or throughout by a hæmorrhagic or sero-hæmorrhagic
exudation of a dark purplish color. If killed in the
early stages this may be very restricted in area, but becomes general
in animals that have died of the disease. Similar exudations
are found on the walls of the first three stomachs, or on the small
or large intestines. The fourth stomach and duodenum are, as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>rule, empty of food, though containing a sanguineous liquid.
The contents of the large intestines are usually dry and hard.
Some serous exudate is usually present in the peritoneum, pleura
and pericardium. The spleen may be normal or slightly enlarged.
The liver is pale, soft and friable. The kidneys may be
congested and swollen and usually show brownish areas of necrosis
in which the bacillus is readily found. The blood is dark,
and though it may be coagulated, the clot is usually soft and
diffluent.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> Much may be done in the way of drainage and
above all cultivation and liming of the braxy pastures, and again
laying them down in grass. Cowan found that braxy diminished
largely in ratio with the improvement and cultivation of the soil. A
rotation of crops and the free æration of the soil tends to destroy
an anærobic microbe or to render it non-virulent. Winter feeding
is another well attested source of protection. Hay with turnips,
oats, linseed cake or oil cake seems to encrease the tone and vigor,
and to counteract the fermentations in the digestive organs which
lay the system open to attack. Wholesome and nutritious food
then must be a main stay whenever the health threatens to be
undermined by insufficient or unwholesome pasture, by dried or
withered grass, ferns or heather, by the watery grass of recent
and rapid growth, by frosted and partially decayed herbage, or
by pasture exhausted by overstocking or drought.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fields and hills known to be infecting must be abandoned
especially in late fall and winter and in the case of the younger
and more susceptible sheep. Understocking is always better than
overstocking as the flock is kept better nourished, stronger and
with a greater measure of tolerance and resistance. Upon land
covered with old, fibrous, astringent heather, burning is often of
great value. The new growth of young heather is much more
digestible and nutritious, and destitute of injurious astringency,
and maintains a stronger and healthier flock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally the question of <i>immunization</i> arises. Nielsen attempted
this by drying and heating to sterilization the diseased kidney
and injected small quantities of this suspended in water. Sheep
treated in this way in Norway and Iceland have had a circumscribed
inflammatory swelling and afterward appeared to resist
casual infection when placed on the braxy fields. Jensen carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>the experiment a step farther and inoculated his artificially immunized
sheep with 2½ cc. of a virulent serum-gelatine-agar
culture. It was rather unwell for half a day and walked lame
but soon recovered. A dose of ¹⁄₃₀ cc. of the same culture killed
in fifteen hours a larger sheep that had not been artificially immunized.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> Though some cases of braxy recover yet the treatment
of the disease can hardly be seriously considered as yet.
A disorder which is so rapid in its progress, so early associated
with such great and rapidly extending lesions of the most vital
organs, and which proves fatal so early and almost invariably,
leaves little room for a successful treatment. In the milder cases,
likely to recover of their own accord, this may be hastened by
the internal use of antiseptics and purgatives, and perhaps even
by antitoxic serum from the blood of an immunized animal.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SOUTH AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS. ŒDEMA MYCOSIS. DUNPAARDZIEKTE. DIKKOPZIEKTE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Definition: Geographical distribution: S. Africa; enzoötic or epizoötic on
damp soils; damp, humid atmosphere. Pathogenesis: horses, and more mildly
mules and asses, quagga; (cattle and goats?). Causes: green forage, from
rich, damp lands, eaten dewy; cut and fed with dew on; dried in sun safe;
so of horses stabled or corralled; in hot summer only; inoculable; penicillium;
cultures cause the disease; debility. Forms: lung sickness—head
sickness—blue tongue. Symptoms: incubation 8 days. Fulminant
form asphyxiates in an hour. Acute lung form has rigor; remittent hyperthermia;
prostration; dyspnœa; cyanosis; serous nasal discharge; frothing;
gurgling breathing; cough; death in 3 or 4 days. Head œdema;
general swelling and oozing of serum. Blue tongue: great lingual swelling;
cyanosis; coldness; projection from mouth; salivation; stertor; asphyxia.
Three forms combined. Mortality. Lesions: serous exudate coagulates
with heat or blood; intermuscular exudates; whole head densely infiltrated;
excessive bloody pleural effusion; punctiform petechiæ; lungs pale, yellow,
great interlobular infiltration; or, if worked, hepatization; dark, congested
mucosæ; blood diffluent; heart pale; spleen enlarged, blood-gorged; kidneys
infiltrated; gastro-intestinal congestions; cerebro-spinal effusion.
Prevention: keep indoors during summer and autumn; allow no fresh
damp forage; or cut only after dew is off; check rein or muzzle; pastured
horses must be stabled at night or in damp weather. Immunization: by
protective inoculations; recovered horse is re-inoculated until a high grade
of resistance is secured and his blood used to immunize.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span><i>Definition.</i> An ectogenous, infective disease of solipeds in
South Africa, characterized by intense vascular congestions, destructive
changes in the blood and the profuse exudation of liquor
sanguinis into the tissues of the affected parts.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> The affection is not known out of
South Africa, where it has been observed since 1780. It appears
yearly in certain areas in the Transvaal, Orange River Colony,
Natal, and adjacent States, but only in certain years in Cape
Colony and especially in its southern portion. In certain years
it makes wide extensions so that it has appeared to become epizoötic
instead of enzoötic. The habitual enzoötic prevalence is
in the areas that are relatively lower, damper and richer than the
surrounding country, where the vegetation is luxuriant and the
surface of the ground moist. Thus it is a disease of low meadows,
basins, river bottoms, drying marshes or ponds, and the Boers
have been in the habit of protecting their horses by sending them
to high, dry tablelands, from the first appearance of the disease
until the first frost. Yet elevation in itself is no protection, thus
Johannisburg, 6000 feet above the sea, is habitually ravaged and
Rhodesia loses 90 per cent. annually. A humid atmosphere,
mist, or rain with a high temperature are directly connected with
the outbreaks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals susceptible.</i> Horses take the disease in its most fatal
form. Mules suffer like horses, while in asses the disease is
relatively somewhat more benign, and the virus after having passed
through the ass, has lost part of its potency. A disease of a
similar nature is seen in cattle and goats. The quagga is also
alleged to suffer (Edington).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The disease has been traced to the green forage,
grown in damp, hot seasons on the rich moist bottom lands, in
basins, gullies, etc., and which has been consumed while damp
with night dews or fog. Few suffer that are only turned out to
pasture after the sun has dried up the dew, and that are shut in
the stable or kraal before sunset. Coley who witnessed a loss of
60 per cent. of the stabled horses at Eshowe, Zululand, found
that the deaths were among horses that had been allowed to eat
their fodder wet. The Guinea or Ubaaba grass and Indian corn
were cut at night and fed to the horses next day. The horses that
ate this wet from the bundles were attacked, while those that had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>it only after it had been opened and dried in the sun escaped.
Race horses that receive no green fodder very rarely suffer.
Horses that are corralled (in kraal) at night escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hot season is the season of greatest prevalence, the disease
beginning in November and proving especially fatal from the end
of December to the first of March. It appears in a modified form
until May when the first frosts appear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the disease can be fatally inoculated by transferring
the blood from one horse to another, it is the rarest possible
occurrence to have it propagated in this way. It can be absolutely
prevented therefore by attention to the diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The real cause of <i>horse sickness</i> is a mold having the general
characters of a penicillium, and which enters the system with the
moist, dewy food. Edington, who discovered this cryptogam,
has found it in the blood in all his necropsies of horses dying of
horse sickness. Why this should be no longer infecting when
dried does not clearly appear. It has been alleged that the disease
has gradually extended to the higher grounds which were
formerly free from it, and the introduction of diseased or infected
horses has been advanced as the cause, but in the unfenced state
of the veldt and the former abundance of wild animals this should
have ensured such extension long ago, if it is really a permanent
one. The deadly prevalence of the malady in particular areas in
given years, and its entire absence from such localities in others
may explain the instances of apparent extension. The dryness
and cold of winter is the factor which usually extinguishes the
poison in a given district. We have as yet no absolute proof of
a progressive acclimatisation of the germ in a colder and drier
region. Wittshire observes that it will prevail on one side of a
narrow river, while the other at an equal elevation is practically
free from it. There is no mention of shade which might have
explained such a difference in the growth of cryptogams on the
right and left banks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such limitations, together with the activity of the infection in
damp seasons, and during damp hours of the day, and its inactivity
in dry air and vegetation, would strongly suggest a microbe
which is conveyed in the body of some invertebrate, but this
appears to be nonessential because Edington has cultivated
his mold in vitro and inoculated its products on horses so as to
secure immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>Debility doubtless renders an animal more susceptible, yet the
disease usually kills nearly all horses attacked, excepting such as
have been immunized. This is the same for casual and inoculated
cases. When, however, the virulence has been lessened by
culture or by passing through the body of an unsuitable animal
the results are very uncertain; some horses it will kill, while in
others it produces a slight and harmless fever.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Forms.</i> Two leading forms of the disease are known: 1st,
the <i>lung sickness</i> (<i>Dunpaardziekte</i>), and 2nd, the <i>head sickness</i>
(<i>Dikkopziekte</i>). A variety of this last is <i>blue tongue</i> (Blautong),
which has been confounded with gloss-anthrax.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The <i>lung sickness</i> may appear as a fulminant affection
following on the usual <i>incubation</i> of about eight days. Suddenly,
in the midst of apparently full health and vigor, the
breathing becomes accelerated and dyspnœic; this encreases for
about an hour, then the patient staggers, falls, ejects a mass
of white froth from mouth and nostrils and dies. When death
is more delayed, there may be noted a rigor, and in the evening
a rise of temperature to 103° F., lowering a little next
morning and rising again toward night, yet making an encrease
day by day until near the end, when it becomes subnormal.
Death in such cases occurs on the third or fourth day, preceded
by great prostration, hurried, labored breathing, dark red or
cyanosed mucosæ, loud rattling over the large bronchia or lower
end of the trachea, coughing and dropping of a serous fluid from
the nose, or accumulation of white froth around nostrils and
mouth. The froth soon condenses in part into a straw-colored
liquid, which collects in considerable quantity. The abundance
of froth blocking the air passages produces death by suffocation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>head œdema</i>, the muzzle, lips, head and neck become the
seat of excessive exudation, the swelling of the face drawing
back the lips so as to expose the teeth of the lower jaw. The
skin is rendered tense and exudes the straw-colored serum, as do
also the buccal and pituitary mucosæ.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>blue tongue</i> the exudate is concentrated in the lingual organ,
which swells to an enormous size, forcing the jaws and lips apart,
and hanging out as a dark blue, cold mass. A foul, liquid mixture
of saliva and exudate drivels from the mouth. The pressure
on the larynx may cause marked stertor, advancing to asphyxia.</p>

<p class='c008'>While these three types may seem to be distinct and uncomplicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>in some cases, more commonly the exudation appears to a
slight extent in all three situations, and it is only the predominance
of the symptoms in one particular part that assigns the
attack to one type rather than another. All are very fatal, but
the lung sickness is preëminently so, very few such surviving.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> There is usually a mass of white froth around the
mouth and nostrils. The serous exudate coagulates readily in
the presence of minute traces of blood, and forms a solid mass of
clot when heated. A yellow gelatinoid exudate is found in
streaks or patches, subcutaneously and between the muscles, but
especially along the jugular furrow. In the <i>head sickness</i> the
whole subcutaneous and intermuscular tissue in the head and
neck are infiltrated, and the straw-colored liquid escapes abundantly
when the part is scarified. The same is true of the tongue,
which is stained throughout with blood that has gravitated into it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pleuræ contain an abundant exudate more or less deeply
stained with blood. The same is true of the pericardium. In
the latter Edington has found 140 fluid ounces. On the surface
of the lungs and pericardium are extensive yellowish exudates.
They are covered with petechiæ mostly small or punctiform. If
the horse has stood at rest throughout the illness the lungs seem
pale, yellowish, yet swollen and indisposed to collapse. The interlobular
tissue especially is infiltrated with serum so that toward
the free margin the lobules may be separated by intervals of half
an inch in breadth as in lung plague of cattle. In horses that
have been worked during the illness the whole organ is congested
and firm, resembling the condition of croupous pneumonia. The
trachea and bronchia show dark congestion of the mucosæ and a
mixture of froth and serous exudate. The large blood vessels
contain diffluent blood clots of an intensely dark color. In the
vascular furrows of the heart and along the large vessels are yellow
exudates or blood extravasations. The muscular tissue of
the heart appears normal or rather pale, and under the microscope
the striæ are found to be obscured by cloudy swelling, and
minute blood extravasations and hæmatin are met with. The
endocardium is cloudy, with blood extravasations, and exceptionally
ante-mortem clots are found. The spleen is usually swollen,
very dark, blood gorged and covered with petechiæ. On section
there are found extensive extravasations, with masses of blood
pigment and crystals. The kidneys are enlarged, the capsule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>easily detached, the epithelium of the glomeruli and convoluted
tubes swollen and their nuclei multiplied. A gelatinoid exudate
is usually present in the renal pelvis. Congestions have been
found in the right gastric <i>cul-de-sac</i> and less frequently in the intestines.
Exudations have also been found in the cerebro-spinal
nervous system, the laryngeal mucosa and the conjunctiva. The
latter is usually cyanosed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> The first consideration is to keep work horses indoors
or in a kraal during the summer or sickly season. Here
they must be fed on dry hay and grain only, grass being strictly
withheld. If it becomes absolutely necessary to feed green fodder
of any kind it should not be cut until all dew or rain has completely
dried off in the heat of the sun, and if kept over night
should be kept under cover and again dried before feeding.
When taken out to work the animal should wear a check rein or
muzzle so that he cannot by any chance reach the green vegetation.
This rule must be most strictly adhered to at night or during
damp weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>For horses turned to pasture a fair amount of protection may
be secured by shutting them in a stable or kraal before sundown,
and until the vegetation has been thoroughly dried by the sun
the next morning.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunization.</i> A horse that has recovered from the <i>sickness</i>
has been long held to be immune and will bring from six to ten
times its former price. As any disease is liable to be called the
sickness this enhanced value is too often insubstantial. Wiltshire
even says that all “salted” horses eventually die of <i>horse
sickness</i> if allowed to live long enough. Be this as it may Edington
appears to have established a reasonable measure of immunity
by his protective inoculations. He takes a recovered (‘salted’)
animal and reinoculates it at intervals with encreased doses of
virulent blood. After the last of these inoculations the subject is
allowed to rest for a long period of time, and is then re-inoculated
with a small dose of virulent blood. A definite amount of this
horse’s virulent blood is mixed with 50cc. of serum and injected
subcutaneously; some days later 30cc. of the same serum with
the same dose of blood is injected; at a later date the procedure is
repeated, with a reduced dose of serum, and fourteen days later
pure virulent blood is injected.” The result has been perfectly
satisfactory.</p>

<i>Maladie du Coit</i>; <i>Chancrous Epizoötic</i>; <i>Breeding Paralysis</i>;
<i>Epizoötic Paraplegia</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> A contagious affection of solipeds, transmitted by
copulation, and attended by specific lesions in the generative
organs and nervous system, such as local venereal swellings,
chancrous ulcers and cicatrices, dementia and paralysis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Susceptibility.</i> As occurring casually the disease is essentially
an equine one, yet the following species are susceptible to experimental
inoculation in the order named: dogs, rabbits, rats,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>mice, asses. While the horse shows the greatest susceptibility,
the ass is comparatively very resistant to the poison.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History.</i> The malady has probably long prevailed in the east,
yet it was first clearly distinguished in 1796 when described by
Ammon as prevailing in the royal stud at Trakehnen in Northern
Prussia. We have later descriptions of the disease in the same
locality in 1801 (Hertwig), and 1807 (Ammon). It was found
in Bromberg in 1817 to 1820 (Waltersdorf), also in Hanover
(Haveman), in Austria and Bohemia in 1821–8 (Fischer), in
Styria in 1821, in Switzerland in 1830, in France in 1830–2 (Lautour),
in Silesia and Pomerania in 1833–40 (Fischer), in Italy in
1836, in Russia in 1843, (Fischer), in Silesia and Poland in
1830–40 (Freidberger and Fröhner), in Algiers in 1847–55, and
in Syria and Asia generally and perennially (Daumas and Signol).</p>

<p class='c008'>It appeared at Bloomington, Ill., in 1882, the first affected
animal being a brown stallion that had been imported from France
and which bore on his neck a brand like the letter D. In this
locality it extended to a considerable number of breeding mares
and stallions, and having been recognized by Dr. W. L. Williams,
was largely stamped out by a rigid quarantine of diseased and
exposed animals. Some exposed animals had, however, left the
district, and isolated centres of infection have been since found
in Nebraska and elsewhere in the United States.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not known to have invaded Belgium, Scandinavia, England,
South America nor Australasia.</p>

<p class='c008'>All indications point to Asia or North Africa as the primal
home of the disease, as they still prove its perennial one.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The disease is transmitted by contagion and almost
exclusively in the act of coition. Hayne has seen the affection in
geldings, and Haxthausen in mares that had never been served.
Schneider, Buffard, Nocard, Blaise and others have transmitted it
freely by inoculation of blood and nervous matter, so that the
possibility of infection through other channels than the generative
organs must be admitted. But such irregular means of casual
infection are so rare, and the probability of transmission of the
virus from a non-breeding animal is so remote that in the practical
measures of sanitary police, the breeding horses alone need be
taken into account.</p>

<p class='c008'>The extra vascularity of the male and female generative organs
at the period of coition undoubtedly favors infection, as a latent or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>apparently recovered case will relapse under its frequent repetition.
The abrasion of the epithelial surface also forms infection atria
and favors new multiple points of infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The disease has occurred congenitally (Rodolff, Jessen). It
has been claimed that the higher bred horses with lighter frames
are the more susceptible (Fischer), but this is probably a delusion,
the disease having been often introduced by the Barb and Arabian
and propagated among their grade descendants. The heavy Percheron
shows a very ready susceptibility and a virulent and fatal
form of the affection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> That the affection was due to a microbe was
clearly shown by its absence from every part of the world into
which infected horses had not been brought. The secluded
countries, Belgium, England, Scandinavia, that breed their own
horses, the distant Australia, New Zealand and South America
remained free in face of the constant presence of the infection in
different parts of Central and Southern Europe, in Africa and
Asia. The horses of America and South Africa showed a ready
susceptibility to the virus brought by infected horses, and rigorous
sanitary police control speedily cleared a district of the trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thanhoffer found in the blood, vaginal mucous, testicle, semen,
spinal fluid, myelon, and roots of the dorsal and lumbar nerves
cocci, especially streptococci and less constantly bacilli, to which
he attributed the malady. More recently Schneider and Buffard
have apparently demonstrated that an infusorian, the <i>trypanosoma
of dourine</i>, is the essential pathogenic agent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>Trypanosoma Equiperdum</i> varies greatly in form at different
stages of its growth or in different media. In the exudate of
the slight early tumefaction, without as yet other symptoms, it is
found as minute granules in groups, as larger spherical very refrangent
bodies like very large cocci, each having a strongly
staining nucleus, and as larger bodies in which a delicate membranous
covering encloses one, two or three masses of chromatin
and extends to form one or more points (club-shaped or fusiform).
Each chromatin mass has a nucleolus on its outer surface
or slightly apart from it. Twenty-four hours later there may be
added: First, short, thick chromatin bodies, with two slightly
undulating, pointed, membranous prolongations. Second, more
delicate, fusiform bodies, each with one chromatin nucleus, a detached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>nucleolus, and the membrane prolonged into two actively
moving flagella. Third, larger pyriform bodies with chromatin
nuclei and nucleoli and the membrane prolonged into one or several
flagella. Fourth, fusiform bodies, thick or delicate, each
having a chromatin nucleus and nucleolus, and arranged singly
or in groups of two, four, six or more, united together at one
end and diverging at the other to form a stellate mass. These
last, 20 to 30μ long by 1.5 to 2μ broad, may perhaps be the adult
form of the parasite from which the small granular or spore
forms found in the most recent lesions are derived. The fusiform
outline, the deep staining central mass, with its adjacent
nucleolus, and the pointed or flagellate membranous prolongations,
more or less motile or undulating, are characteristic features.</p>

<p class='c008'>In its morphology and evolutionary forms the trypanosoma of
dourine has not been shown to differ from that of surra, nor the
nagana or Tsétsé disease, the granule form, the spherical,
the club-shaped or pyriform, the fusiform with more or less stellate
grouping, are characteristic of all (Lydia Rabinowitsch,
Kemper, Schneider, Buffard). The distinction is found in the
pathogenesis of the two diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>With active cutaneous or mucous lesions, the parasite is usually
found abundantly in the blood, sperm, milk, vaginal secretions,
and the erosions of the vaginal mucosa or penis. During intermissions,
however, and in the absence of local lesions, examination
of the blood may fail to detect it, yet its inoculation on a dog
will usually produce the affection. It disappears from the blood
and tissues with great rapidity after death, so that, to prove successful,
inoculations should be made before death or immediately
after. They are ineffective after 48 hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>Schneider and Buffard, Nocard and others found the trypanosoma
in the blood and exudates of horses, asses and dogs, suffering
from dourine, and failed to find it, in the same localities,
in animals of the same species which were free from dourine.
The infected blood, preserved for 24 hours in sealed glass tubes,
and then inoculated on two dogs produced characteristic dourine,
with the extensive production of trypanosoma in the blood, the
destruction of blood globules, and the pathognomonic local lesions.
Inoculation of two other dogs, with the same material, at the end
of 48 hours produced a slight transient hyperthermia only,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>without local lesions or propagation of the parasite in the blood.
The same blood inoculated after 15 days produced neither local
lesion nor fever.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> <i>Horse.</i> In the early stages are found a phlegmonous
or œdematous swelling of the <i>sheath</i>, <i>scrotum</i>, <i>penis</i> and <i>inguinal
glands</i> and a yellowish liquid effusion into the scrotal cavity.
The skin covering these parts may show a papular or vesicular
eruption or if this has passed, a mottling with white spots shows
where the lesions have been. Later still the <i>inguinal glands</i> are
shrunken and have undergone fibroid degeneration and induration
and the testicles, swollen or shrunken, contain centres of
caseation. The connective tissue of the epididymus and cord is
the seat of a gelatinoid exudation. The <i>walls of the scrotum</i> may
be greatly thickened and the seat of abscess or of caseous degenerated
hyperplasia. In advanced cases the <i>testicles</i> are usually
abnormally small even if the scrotal mass is enormously distended.
The <i>sheath</i> and <i>penis</i> may be the seat of more or less
numerous ulcers, and swellings, contractions and distortions of
the latter organ are not uncommon. The penis may, however,
retain its normal dimensions. The walls of the <i>lymphatics</i> in the
inguinal region may be the seat of hyperplasia, the thickening
causing them to stand out like cords as in glanders. In the advanced
stages the <i>muscles</i>, especially those of the hind limbs, become
pale and atrophied.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>nerve centres</i> undergo profound changes which have been
studied by Thanhoffer. The <i>pia mater</i> in the affected parts of
the spinal cord is the seat of active congestion and thickening.
The central canal of the cord is dilated (syringomyelia) more at
one point than another, contains more than the normal amount
of liquid, and the neuroglia around it is thickened and fibrous
(sclerosed). The <i>substance of the cord</i>, both white and gray,
shows congestion, blood staining, at points foci of softening, and
at others induration (hyperplasia of the neuroglia). The <i>nerve
cells</i> are modified in various ways, some being granular, some discolored
by fine granular pigment, some having enlarged and multiplied
nuclei, and some show vacuoles. The <i>nerve filaments</i>
often show a granular degeneration extending from the nerve
cell into the axis cylinder, and the latter is liable to be varicose
or uneven in size. In the affected portion of the cord leucocytes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>are numerous and hyperplasia is often present. The neuroglia
especially tends to encrease, and apart from the foci of softening
tends to give a special firmness to the substance. At intervals,
in the perivascular spaces, may often be found minute (microscopic
or macroscopic) blood clots. The subarachnoid and subdural
fluid is encreased and may be pinkish. At the roots of
spinal nerves, especially in the dorsal and lumbar regions, a gelatinoid
exudate may invest the nerve, distending the connective
tissue beneath the neurilemma and even occupying the interval
between the nerve filaments. Sometimes large corpuscular
bodies are found between the nerve fibres.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>cerebral meninges</i>, especially the <i>pia mater</i>, are congested
and opaque. Foci of softening are by no means uncommon and
the cerebral ventricles contain an abnormal quantity of fluid.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>bony tissue</i> generally has lost its consistency and the medullary
matter may be unduly reddened. The large joints contain
an excess of synovia somewhat pinkish in color, and the ligaments
of the hip joints are often congested, thickened and softened.
The articular cartilage may even show patches of blood
staining.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>intestines</i> are usually nearly empty, soft, pale and flaccid,
and Ruthe has in one case observed rounded ulcers on the mucosa.
Fibroid thickening on the peritoneal surface may indicate a previous
exudate.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>mesentery</i> is thickened, with infiltration and has a yellowish
discoloration and the <i>mesenteric glands</i> are usually enlarged,
softened and friable, though sometimes firm and contracted. The
<i>lymph glands</i> adjoining the generative organs are often swollen,
pigmented and studded with foci of caseation, varying in size from
a pea upward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>liver</i> is softened and congested or fatty. The <i>spleen</i> is
small.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>kidneys</i> are usually large, but flaccid, pale and bleached.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>thoracic organs</i> may show little change, though hypostatic
inflammation and foci of caseation or suppuration may be present.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>blood</i> is pale and watery and forms a loose, pale, diffluent
clot, while there is an extraordinary diminution of red globules
and a relatively great encrease of leucocytes.</p>

<p class='c008'>In advanced stages the <i>muscles</i> are pale, anæmic and shrunken
especially those of the hind limbs.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span><i>Mare.</i> In the mare in addition to the lesions of the internal
organs and blood, the following may be noted in connection with
the generative system. Phlegmonous or œdematous swellings,
sores or ulcers on the lips of the vulva, and on the vulvar and
vaginal mucosæ. The parts become variously distorted, and the
vulva, habitually open may expose the swollen and ulcerated
clitoris. A crop of papules or vesicles, running into sores or
ulcers may appear on the urethral orifice, the vulva and adjacent
skin, and even though overlooked, their seats are marked later
by loss of cutaneous pigment and the formation of small white
spots. The mammæ are sometimes inflamed, œdematous and
tender, with suppurative or necrotic foci and the adjacent lymph
glands are enlarged by infiltration or contracted by sclerosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dog.</i> These resemble those in horses. In the bitch genito-urinary
congestion, inflammation and catarrh, subcutaneous infiltration
under the belly and inside the thighs, swelling of the
inguinal lymph glands, emaciation, and pallor and atrophy of the
voluntary muscles are marked features.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> <i>Horse.</i> Incubation may last from one to eight
weeks (Maresch), but is usually 11 days from the infecting
service. It may be abridged by a special susceptibility, and by
repeated infections and hence the more acute cases are especially
seen in the male in daily service. In some such subjects local
genital infiltrations are speedily followed by paralysis or vertigo
which cuts off the patient in a few days.</p>

<p class='c008'>More commonly the malady is <i>chronic</i> though varying in
different countries, epizoötics or even in particular cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first <i>symptom</i> is slight swelling of the anterior border
and raphe of the sheath, which gradually extends backward to
the scrotum and inguinal region and forward on the abdomen it
may be as far as the brisket. This may be hot and painful, but
is usually œdematous, cool and painless. The infiltration affects
the end of the penis, the meatus may be red and angry with a
slight muco-purulent discharge, and red spots vesicles and ulcers
may stand out clearly on the pigmented surface. Williams never
saw such eruptions in the American cases and doubts their existence
except as the result of injuries. There are frequent semierections
and service is still possible. Later the engorgement extends
to the specially pendent testicles, inguinal glands and others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>adjacent. Paraphymosis is occasionally seen or, more commonly,
the penis hangs out of the sheath soft and flaccid and erection
seems impossible. The local swelling may become excessive,
pressing the testicles up against the inguinal ring, or suppuration
and extensive abscess may follow. Appetite is retained and the
temperature remains moderate (100° to 102° F.).</p>

<p class='c008'>The local swellings may almost completely subside, except a
slight tumefaction of the end of the penis, hence some (Fischer)
have held that the cutaneous lesions are the primary ones, yet the
start of infection at the generative organs and the fact that a
stallion often infects a number of mares before there is any suspicion
of his own infirmity is evidence enough of the genital seat
of the earliest lesions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cutaneous lesions, which are essentially secondary, but
highly characteristic, appear from forty to sixty days after the
infection (Schneider and Buffard). They are from a quarter of
a dollar and upward in size (in some old horses much smaller),
and rise abruptly from the healthy skin, becoming the more marked
that the hairs upon them stand erect. These may arise suddenly
and subside again in one day, or give out a serous exudate
which mats the hairs into a tuft. They may, however, last four
or five days. These are more patent after a full drink of water,
or after sprinkling or sponging with water. Even when they
have been overlooked these results may often be seen later on
colored skins, in the presence of many circular white spots entirely
devoid of pigment. The most common seat of these cutaneous
lesions is the hind parts (anus, tail, croup, quarters), but they
may appear on the sides, neck, shoulder or thighs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tenderness of the loins may now be shown, with frequent,
painful micturition, but the penis becomes more and more paretic,
so that coition becomes encreasingly difficult or impossible.
Paresis also shows in the hind limbs, the animal remains recumbent
a great part of the time, rises with difficulty, starts suddenly
forward at the fetlock, and drags the toe on the ground in walking.
Swelling of the joints and tendinous sheaths, with attendant
lameness, is not uncommon. The appetite remains good, yet
emaciation and weakness make marked progress.</p>

<p class='c008'>The advanced stages are characterised by marked anæmia, paraplegia
and dementia. The visible mucosæ are pale, emaciation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>advanced, the patient stubs his toes and sways in walking, and
finally drops unable to rise; or he stands with hind legs straddled
and semi-bent, and largely oblivious of all around him. He may
be too stupid to eat unless the food is placed in his mouth, and
yet the neigh of another horse or a mare may draw forth a feeble
retort, as if the deranged generic instincts remained. Swelling,
or even abscess of the lymph glands, axillary, submaxillary or
inguinal, is usually present, and muco-purulent discharge with
ulceration of the nose or eyes is not uncommon. The joints
crack when moved and fractures are common.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duration of the disease is two or three months, the progress
being more rapid in winter.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mare.</i> Vulvar swelling eight or nine days after service, with
ejection of urine in jets, contraction of the vulva, redness, swelling
and erection of the clitoris, and a muco-purulent discharge are
marked symptoms. European observers note nodules, vesicles
and ulcers on the mucosa and adjacent skin, but these were not
observed in the American cases (Williams). Yet later they
showed the characteristic white spots. Switching of the tail,
stamping of the hind feet and painful straining to urinate are
followed in certain cases by ejection of the urine forcibly in jets
or in small dribblets. The catarrhal discharge is at first watery,
but later becomes viscid, sticky and white, yellow or grayish, or
even red. It mats together the hair of the tail and thighs, and
putrefies, exhaling a repulsive odor. The swelling involves the
space between the thighs and often implicates the mammary
glands and even the floor of the abdomen. The inguinal glands
are often involved, and hyperplasias with degenerations and even
abscesses may appear in this region. As in the stallions the local
lesions may have periods of advance and subsidence, and in favorable
cases, that are not again served, there may seem to be a temporary
recovery. The mare, however, remains infecting, and if
served the local disease is at once roused into activity. The button-like
skin eruptions appears on the quarter as already noticed
of the horse and in grave cases may caseate or suppurate and
burst, forming an indolent and intractable sore. The dark skin
of the vulva and perineum becomes marked by white spots or by
irregular patches caused by the confluence of several such spots,
which for ordinary breeds of horses are highly characteristic of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>this disease. Many Arabian horses naturally acquire such white
spots on the dark skin, and in pure Arabs and grades this appearance
need not be held as evidence of dourine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Infected mares rarely conceive, and any that do so are likely to
abort before the sixth month.</p>

<p class='c008'>The systemic symptoms, nervous, paralytic, tremulous, dyspeptic,
atrophic, cerebral and cachectic follow a similar course as in
the stallion.</p>

<p class='c008'>In grave and progressive cases the lesions of the generative organs
become very marked. The lips of the vulva become rigid
and distorted so that it remains constantly open and the erect
clitoris continually exposed. The skin of the vulva is tense, dry
and shining. Lameness is shown in one or both hind limbs,
knuckling over at the fetlock, shortening of the step, planting the
toe first and the heel later with a jerk, lack of balance, paresis
and even inability to rise.</p>

<p class='c008'>A disposition to trembling is common to both sexes, as is also
an intolerable itching of the skin which may make the animals
tear the lower parts of the limbs with the teeth. In either there
may be a local paralysis of a lip, an ear, an eyelid, or some other
part of the body. In both sexes the disease tends to extreme
anæmia, debility and emaciation, and to infective internal inflammations
(lungs, bronchia) or septic or purulent infections.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> From <i>urticaria</i> this disease is to be distinguished
by the absence of lesions of the generative organs in the former,
by its association with change of food and digestive disorder and
by the absence of all evidence of contagion.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>glanders</i> it is to be distinguished in the same way by its
casual transmission by sexual connection only, by its restriction
to breeding animals, and by the irresponsiveness of the victim to
the mallein test. The progressive paresis and hebetude are
valuable diagnostic phenomena.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>chronic paraplegia</i> it is distinguished by the same prevalence
in breeding solipeds only, and by its mode of transmission.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest difficulty is experienced with the slight and comparatively
occult cases, and in some of these the history of the
infection of a number of breeding animals, which have been
served by the same horse may be the one guiding point for a
number of the cases. For sanitary purposes it is well to treat as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>suspicious animals all mares that have been served by a stallion
which is in the line of infection. This suspicion would attach
also to any stallion that had served a mare which had been to a
diseased or suspected stallion, and to all mares that have been
served by the suspected stallion after he had been to the suspected
mare.</p>

<p class='c008'>From <i>simple vesicular exanthema</i> dourine is to be distinguished
by its comparatively slow progress, and by the uniformity of the
lesions of the generative organs and nervous system, which are
lacking in the vesicular affection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis.</i> A certain number of animals recover from the
milder attacks which have not become complicated by the grave
trophic and nervous lesions, but as in glanders, recovery from
severe attacks and in the advanced stages is practically unknown.
The mortality is set at 70 per cent. and upward.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in the Ass and Mule.</i> The disease usually remains
discrete, the lesions in the generative organs or other seat of infection
being the marked symptoms, and recovery the rule.
Œdema of the end of the penis, obliteration of the folds around
the orifice of the urethra and eversion of the urethral mucosa are
the most constant features, distinct even in semi-erection. Œdema
of the sheath and skin eruption may follow. Exceptionally a
mule proves as susceptible as the horse, and shows the disease
with the same fatal severity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Dog.</i> A bitch, 15 days after vaginal injection
of the infected equine blood, showed severe vaginitis and hyperthermia
(100°). On the 23d day she aborted, followed by muco-purulent
discharge, vulvar œdema, pallor of the mucosæ,
anæmia, rapid emaciation, paresis and occasional convulsions.
Blood drawn from the vulva contained the trypanosoma. She
died on the 66th day. The temperature rose to 103°.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two male dogs that lined the above infected bitch showed after
12 days, engorgement of the sheath and scrotum, muco-purulent
discharge, and abundance of the trypanosoma in the blood of the
affected parts. Cutaneous lesions on the loins, thighs, sides or
forehead, showed erection of the hair, with infiltration, or
shrivelling and bloodlessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other dogs showed arthritis, corneal opacities and ulcers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>hypopion, cataract, nasal discharges, facial periostitis, dyspnœa
and syncope.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms in Rabbits.</i> Rouget found in inoculated rabbits,
extensive gangrene of the skin, involving even the cranial bones,
ulcerative keratitis, hypopion, panophthalmia, following on the
earlier genital troubles of vaginitis, swelling and discharge.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> Some cases recover spontaneously a few may be
aborted in the earliest stage of the disease, but cases that have
advanced to any extent and assumed a grave character are practically
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c008'>An important element in treatment is to do away as far as possible
with the cause of generative excitement since the disease
is aggravated and more rapidly advanced by frequent copulation.
Rodloff from a very wide experience speaks highly of castration
of the stallion. Castration of the mare has not been specially
advocated and the absence of marked lesions in the ovaries, may
deter the veterinarian, yet whatever promises to lessen in any degree
the genesic excitement is not to be despised, and the measure
has besides a sanitary value for other animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early local treatment is the most promising, and especially if
it can be applied to exposed animals during apparent incubation.
Injection of the urethra, sheath, vulva, vagina and uterus with
antiseptic lotions, and apply them to the external sores. Mercuric
chloride 1:2000, carbolic acid 2:100, silver nitrate 1:250, calcium
chloride 1:100, or chlorine water may be taken as examples. When
local swellings have supervened it would be entirely appropriate to
incise them freely or even to excise them and cauterize thoroughly
with stronger agents.</p>

<p class='c008'>Internal treatment by mercuric chloride 1½ to 3 grains, potassium
iodide 2 to 5 drs., arsenic 7 to 14 grains, has been widely
used but to little purpose. The same may be said of Rodloff’s
treatment by tonics and carminatives (sal ammoniac, camphor,
iron, angelica, gentian, ginger and valerian.)</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> The one thing to be secured is the prevention of
copulation with any animal that has been affected, or exposed to
this disease in the past three years.</p>

<p class='c008'>1st. Any stallion or mare once affected must be excluded from
breeding for at least three years after apparent recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. Every such animal that has been exposed by copulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>with a suspected animal must be excluded from breeding for the
same period even if no active symptoms have been shown.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d. Every affected or exposed animal, should be quarantined
in the hands of his or her owner and placed on an official register
and the sale, gift or loan of such an animal, or its movement to a
new place where it might propagate the disease should be made a
misdemeanor.</p>

<p class='c008'>4th. In any county or district in which the disease exists all
stallions and mares should be registered and none should be
allowed to be used for breeding purposes without an official
certificate showing that each of the animals mated is free from
all suspicion of having been exposed to this infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>5th. If any stallion or mare is imported from a country in
which dourine exists it should be accompanied by an official certificate
showing that it has not in the past three years been exposed
to the possibility of infection with dourine.</p>

<p class='c008'>6th. In the absence of such certificate the imported animal
(capable of breeding) should be kept in strict quarantine for the
period of three years.</p>

<p class='c008'>7th. A much more radical measure, which may be made to
supersede all of the above, would be to castrate every soliped
(stallion or mare) which has suffered from the disease in the past
three years, and every such animal that has by coition been exposed
during that length of time to even a remote opportunity
for contagion. This would embrace all apparently sound mares
that had been served by a stallion which had shown slight symptoms
of the disease, or by a stallion which had not himself shown
such symptoms, but which had served a mare that had shown
such symptoms; or one that had served a mare that had not
shown such symptoms, but that had been previously served by a
stallion which had shown such symptoms, or that previously covered
a mare that had shown such symptoms. In such cases the
State might well afford to indemnify the owner for any reduction
in value of the castrated stallion from that borne by the animal as
a prospective breeder, the breeding for which indemnity is sought
being understood to count only from a date of three years after
the sanitary castration. A mare once attacked should be remorselessly
castrated or killed. A perfect recovery in a horse can be
better attested; that of a mare is always uncertain, and most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>secondary outbreaks after the apparent extinction of the poison
have come from breeding mares that have apparently recovered,
or that after exposure have shown no appreciable symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a State is so lost to all sanitary considerations as to
abandon an affection of this kind to take its course, the owners of
stallions and mares cannot be too careful to avoid the exposure of
their valuable breeders to the risk of infection. Each mare
brought for service should be admitted only when accompanied
by a certificate showing all previous services in the last three
years, with the identification of the stallion, and this irrespective
of whether the service has been fruitful or not. In such certificate
the owner of the mare should bind himself to make good all
damage or loss that may accrue from his failure to set forth in
the certificate every such service and every symptom of illness
affecting the generative organs from which the mare has suffered
in the three years antecedent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The owner of the stallion should give a similar guarantee that
the horse has in the past three years served no mare that was in
any way open to suspicion, and that the animal has not suffered
from any affection of the generative organs which had any of the
characteristics of dourine.</p>

<p class='c008'>No mare should be served which shows swelling, nodules, distortion,
or gaping vulva, a muco-purulent discharge, or too frequent
or too prolonged <i>heats</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>No stallion in such locality should be allowed to serve which
shows pasty swelling of the sheath, swelling, shrinking or distortion
of the penis, red, angry, tender meatus urinarius, or a
muco-purulent discharge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unless in case of Arabian horses the appearance of white spots
on the dark ground of the sheath, penis, vulva, or perineum,
should be ground for debarring from service until an absolutely
stainless record covering a number of years has been shown.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MAL DE CADERAS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is a disease caused by <i>Trypanosoma Equinum</i> described
by Voges who studied the affection in the Argentine Republic as
it exists in a region extending from Santa Fe, and Corrientes on
the south to Bolivia on the north. It resembles surra in prevailing
in tropical heat, during wet weather, in its intermittent character,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>in the presence of the mature trypanosomata in the blood
at the beginning of a paroxysm and their disappearance toward
the end of it, in the supervention of rapid and extreme emaciation,
debility and anæmia, in the destruction of red blood globules
and the passage of the coloring matter by the kidneys, in the
presence of paresis and œdemas, in its expending its energy
mainly on the soliped and in the constancy of the mortality.
Death occurs in two to five months in horses, and six to twelve
months in asses and mules. Swine and water hogs contract the
disease casually and it is inoculable on white and gray rats, mice,
rabbits, dogs, goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, ducks and monkeys,
(Nyctipithecus felinus), and exceptionally on Guinea pigs.
The same measures of prevention would be indicated as in cases of
surra and dourine.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonym.</i> Quebra Bunda: Broken Buttock.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An acute infectious disease of horses characterized
by a condition of fever, with rapid loss of condition, resulting in
rapid and extreme emaciation, local dropsies, cutaneous eruptions
and ulcers, a rapidly advancing anæmia and debility, with lessening
control of the hind quarters and death in almost all instances.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span><i>History of the Disease.</i> Luis Calendrini da Silva Pacheco
says the malady was unknown on the island until 1830, when, on
account of the great excess of wild horses and their devouring
the pastures needed for the more valuable cattle, great numbers
were killed and their hides marketed. This continued for over a
year without any attempt to dispose of the carcasses. These accordingly
lay in heaps in a damp climate, under the equatorial
sun, in a condition of putrefaction, exhaling the most offensive
odors. Stimulated by frequent complaints, the government ordered
that the carcasses should be burned to ashes, but no success
was accomplished, in one case 800 bodies having been merely
roasted a little on the surface. The district around Chaves contained
the greatest number of horses, there the greatest number
were killed, and there the disease broke out. A number, variously
estimated at from 25,000 to 60,000 were driven into the
little bay of Juncal and killed by burning the grass, which, however,
did not at all consume the bodies. The disease attacked first
the capivaras (rodents) in the district of Chaves, killing off
the whole race; then the wild and domestic swine suffered, and
finally it ravaged the equine race, and though confined to Chaves
for two years it was extended through sales of horses and raged
with such fury that in five years not a horse was left alive in the
island, except a small remnant of a few hundreds in Chaves,
where the infection started.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The microbian cause of the disease has not been
definitely ascertained, so it is idle to speculate whether we have
to deal with a saprophyte which has taken on deadly pathogenic
properties, or whether the infection was carried to the island by
winged insects or birds attracted by the decaying carcasses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Certain conditions may be named as accessory or favoring
causes. The wild horse often escapes so long as he is on the
pasture, but when lassoed, taken to the corral and broken, he
will die in four to six days. This suggests that the infection is
laid up and preserved in the corrals or stables, the mangers or
racks, or possibly in the water supplies. The contact with even
the reins (harness) of other horses is alleged to be a prominent
cause of infection. Another significant point is that around
every hacienda, within a radius of a mile, there are numbers of
carcasses, so that there is every opportunity for the infection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>the wild and susceptible horses caught and brought in. Near
the buildings, too, are accumulations of horse and cattle manure
and rubbish heaps of all kinds, the breeding places of the flies,
which are probably important factors in conveying the infection.
Again, the attacks are more numerous and severe and death
earlier in the hot, dry summer weather, while there is a pause
and a lesser intensity in the cool or rainy season. All domestic
animals, save when kept up for breaking or work, live in the
open field day and night and subsist on the green food (capine,
gramineæ), and are thereby exposed to all climatic changes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> At the first appearance of the disease (1830) it
proved fatal in a few hours, but after a year’s prevalence, when
the more susceptible animals had been killed off, the progress of
the malady became slower, death being deferred to the 8th or
15th day, so that the symptoms could be more definitely followed.
From 7 to 14 days before the more obvious symptoms, there
were lifelessness, tardy movement, hurried breathing, debility,
weakness and emaciation without work or other obvious cause.
Exercise caused difficult breathing, dilated nostrils and great agitation
of the flanks.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most constant symptoms was the loss of power of
the hind limbs which would sway and stagger, the femurs turning
inward, as if dislocated, and on uneven ground the animal
could not walk without falling. When down, he could not rise
without assistance. In the earlier experience of the malady
(1835) only 8 to 16 per cent. failed to show these paraplegic
symptoms, whereas in recent years 50 per cent. or more escape
them. In these cases the emaciation goes on alone, gradually
encreasing until the patient appears like a living skeleton. Some
retain an appearance of liveliness, yet all stand on three limbs,
and change from one hind limb to the other every six or eight
seconds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The retraction of the abdomen is a marked feature, yet expulsive
contraction is defective, the patient fails to put himself in
the position for urination or defecation, and there is more or less
detention of urine or fæces, the latter being dry, moulded, covered
with mucus and of a reddish yellow color. After a time the
urine escapes in fine jets, so small that in the absence of stretching
to urinate, or raising of the tail, they are easily overlooked.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>The urine may be normally clear, or dark colored. The penis
hangs out of the sheath several inches farther than in health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Appetite is sometimes impaired, or completely lost, but usually
the patient eats and drinks to the last, but without proper digestion
or assimilation. It does not check the advance of marasmus.
Thirst often becomes excessive and in such cases, there
is diuresis together with frequent and excessive rumbling of the
bowels. The loins are very sensitive to pinching.</p>

<p class='c008'>About sixty to seventy per cent. in different outbreaks show
œdema, in the epigastric region it may be six inches in diameter,
or it may extend from the sternum back so as to include the abdomen,
sheath, or mammæ, and perineum, and even the hind
limbs. Considerable serous oozing takes place from this for four
or five days after which it dries up.</p>

<p class='c008'>In about seven to fourteen per cent. the head became œdematous
and swollen, with an abundant fœtid purulent discharge from
the nose and eyes, and extensive ulceration of the pituita and
conjunctiva. Such cases became completely blind prior to death.
In other cases extensive ulceration of the skin set in with the
formation of most repulsive sores.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nervous symptoms assumed various forms; in some there
was stupor with head resting on the ground; in others extreme
debility and paraplegia with phenomenally rapid emaciation;
in a few hemiplegia, or even delirium was shown;
in all there was a marked paresis of the digestive organs and
especially impairment of peristalsis. The blood assumed a dark
gluey aspect.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most constant symptoms appear to be dyspnœa under
exercise, paresis of the hind limbs and intestines, genital atony, a
wonderfully rapid and extreme emaciation, œdema, and a tendency
to impaired nutrition or ulcerous degenerations of the pituita,
conjunctiva or skin.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> Congestion or inflammation of the intestines was usually
noted, with petechiæ on the peritoneum, especially the omentum,
and on other serosæ. The serosæ, mucosæ and other normally
white tissues were of a yellowish color, more or less deep. The
liver was enlarged, much softened, gorged with black blood, and
sometimes of a greenish color. The spleen was more or less black,
and friable sometimes coming to pieces in handling. The kidneys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>were always enlarged and gorged with black blood. The bladder
was usually distended and showed petechiæ on its mucosa. The
lungs and bronchia bore evidences of congestion, and the pericardium
had become dull, rough and lusterless. The horses that
had rested their heads on the ground showed meningeal congestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sr. Calendrini claims to have had recoveries in some cases, followed
by relapses, and states that a second relapse is usually fatal.
Many features of the disease reminds one of surra—for example
its relation to hot weather, its relation to buildings and enclosures
with their accumulations of decomposing organic matter and
swarms of flies, the decomposition of the blood, anæmia, icterus
of the white tissues, petechiæ, extreme weakness, muscular
atrophy, and marasmus. Calendrini’s cures followed by relapses
suggest the further coincidence of intermissions. If now the
trypanosoma were discovered in the blood it might be recognized
as at least a near ally of surra.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality.</i> <i>Prognosis.</i> The disease is nearly always fatal.
At the time of its first appearance (1830) Calendrini had 5,000
horses, and in 1835 he mounted his last horse a half-tamed animal
lassoed on the Campo. One Haziendiero invested $25,000 in
horses and in 30 days he had lost $18,000 worth. Others with
35,000 head lost the whole.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> proved one continuous failure. Bleeding, purgatives,
coloquintidas, saltpeter, cream of tartar, lemon, vinegar, nicotine,
buchu, by mouth and rectum, strychnia, camphor, caustics,
prolonged baths in the river, and a great variety of other
measures, only seemed to hasten a fatal result.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> Calendrini finally struck the true note of rational
prophylaxis, in the immediate killing and burial of all affected
animals, and the strict separation of all sound horses from the
places where they had been, together with the thorough disinfection
of all harness, utensils, wagons, etc. For a number of
years his district (Soure) had by this means been kept free from
the plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>This might be profitably extended so as to include the thorough
disinfection of any buildings and yards where the sick had been,
the removal of manure heaps and disinfection of their sites, also
of all rubbish heaps as breeding places of flies, the use of petroleum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>on all stagnant water devoid of fishes and frogs as being
the sources of mosquitoes, and the application of suppressive
measures which would include the rodents (capivaras), and
swine which have been shown to propagate the infection.</p>

and genital lesions. Prognosis: One-fourth to one-third die or fail to recover.
Treatment: Antiseptic washes and irrigations of vagina, urethra,
bladder, skin; internally oil of turpentine; slings. Prevention: Isolation,
disinfection, separate attendants, litter, sponges, etc., fly nets, screens, insect
powder, removal and disinfection of manure and garbage.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Definition.</i> A contagious, non-febrile affection of solipeds,
characterised by congestive and hæmorrhagic lesions of the genito-urinary
mucosa, the spinal cord and its meninges, and by paraplegia
or paresis of the hind limbs.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History.</i> This was described in 1888 by Comeny, as occurring
in a regiment of French cavalry. Other outbreaks have been
observed in 1892 (Rancoule); in 1896 (Blin and Lambert).
Earlier outbreaks have doubtless been confounded with cerebro-spinal
meningitis, hæmoglobinuria or simple paraplegia, the genito-urinary
symptoms having been overlooked or viewed as
secondary.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The disease, as hitherto observed, has been invariably
associated with microbian infection of the genito-urinary mucosa,
but no one microörganism has been found to be constantly present.
In the 1888 cases, Nocard isolated from the kidneys and
lumbar cord a small, motile bacillus which was not stained by
Gram’s method and the inoculation of which proved fruitless.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>Zschokke, in 1889, found in the kidneys, lungs, liver and spleen
of both horses and cattle, the victims of a progressive infectious
paralysis, a bacterium coli commune 1.5μ long by 0.7μ broad,
which stained in methylin blue and grew in agar and gelatine,
and when inoculated under the skin of a goat provoked paralysis.
It had no effect on a pig. In keeping with this, Thomassen, in
1893, alleged that the bacillus coli communis in certain conditions,
when colonized in the solid organs, produced a toxin
which caused paresis and paraplegia. Blin and Lambert, in 1896,
found in the urine, in pure cultures, a short ovoid microbe,
motile, non-liquefying and bleached by Gram’s solution. It grew
on gelose and peptonized gelatine as a creamy surface layer
which did not extend into the medium, and assumed a brownish
color as it became older. On potato it formed a superficial bright
yellow film. In bouillon the surface film which formed gradually
precipitated to the bottom of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>This microörganism was not found in the blood, liver, muscles
nor spinal cord.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inoculation into the pleural cavity of the horse induced pleuro-pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c008'>The contagion appears to be transmitted through the urine and
morbid discharges of the urino-genital canal, falling on the litter
and floor and thus contaminating the tail, and indirectly the generative
organs. The brushes, combs and rubbers used on one
horse after another are similarly incriminated. The mares, having
a wider exposure to infection, appear to suffer most. Comeny
saw eighty sick mares to twenty-eight horses, and the mortality
was thirty-four mares to three horses. The smallness and length
of the male urethra and its frequent flushing throughout its whole
length with urine seems to give a greater measure of immunity to
the horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Blin and Lambert cases the indications pointed to a local
infection and to the presence in the spinal cord of the toxins
alone. It may be assumed that in such cases there was a purely
local infection. In the Zschokke cases on the other hand, with
microbian infection of internal parenchymatous organs the presumption
is that the paralysis was due to a totally different infection,
as appears to be further indicated by the morphology of
the microbe. They may have been, however, but the advanced
and generalized stages of a primary local infection.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span><i>Lesions.</i> These appear to vary with the progressive advance
of the malady. In an ass which was killed as soon as paraplegia
appeared and the necropsy made at once, the lesions were confined
to the vulva, vagina and bladder. In advanced cases the ureters
and kidneys are visibly involved together with the spinal cord,
especially in the lumbar region, and in certain instances the brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vulva is swollen, held habitually open so as to expose the
erect clitoris; the mucosa is irregularly swollen and petechiated,
and there is a glairy or bloody discharge. The swelling usually
extends to the inner side of the thighs, the mammary glands and
the adjacent wall of the abdomen. The vaginal mucosa is congested,
swollen so as to bulge irregularly at intervals and covered
with a glairy muco-purulent matter often mingled with clots of
blood. The urethra and bladder are red and congested, with
marked thickening and ecchymosis of the mucosa and an abundant
serous exudate which extends into the muscular and peritoneal
coats as well. Minute extravasations are found in the two
outer coats and petechiæ of the serosa is the rule. In fatal cases
the ureters and kidneys are involved, the renal parenchyma is
greatly congested and softened, the cortical part especially being
of a dark red, and the glomeruli distinctly enlarged. An oily
sanguineous liquid can be squeezed from the cut surface. The
lumbar portion of the spinal cord together with its meninges, is
congested and arborescent, and in bad cases this may extend
upward to the head and involve the brain and its coverings.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is general congestion of the venous system with black
blood, especially noticeable in the arborescent lines on the inner
surface of the skin and in the serosæ, and the liver and spleen
are gorged with black blood, which, however, reddens on exposure
to the air. Muscles and parenchymatous organs may show a
parboiled appearance. In the male the swelling appears about
the sheath and penis, the papilla, the urethral mucosa and that of
the bladder are deeply congested and petechiated, and the kidneys
and medulla may be implicated as in the mare.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> In the <i>mare</i> the early symptoms are the swelling
and gaping of the vulva, with the muco-purulent or sanguineous
discharge and the presence of redness, congestion and petechiæ of
the mucous membrane.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>horse</i> there is swelling of the sheath and a pendant condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>of the penis, which in its turn may be irregularly reddened
and swollen, and the papilla and orifice of the urethra are deep
red and angry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most commonly these early local symptoms are overlooked
until attention is drawn by some lack of control of the hind quarters.
When moved the animal sways or staggers behind,
knuckles forward at the fetlocks and drags the toe along the
ground. This weakness encreases, and although for a time the
animal can stand steadily, he is liable to fall when we make him
take a step, and when down he will require help to get up. In
advanced stages the animal remains recumbent and cannot be
made to stand even with help, the fore limbs have become implicated
in the paralysis, and in the end the respiratory muscles are
involved and the patient dies asphyxiated. This marks the occurrence
of severe lesions in the medulla oblongata. Incontinence
of urine is a frequent symptom. Fever usually sets in, in advanced
cases. Recoveries may take place from the first and second
stages, the control of the muscular system improves, the
animal lies down and rises with greater ease, the drooping penis
is retracted within the sheath, incontinence of urine ceases,
micturition becoming less frequent and more abundant at a time,
and finally muscular control becomes once more perfect. Convalescence
may be complete in eight days if it begins early, while it
may require two or three months when the disease has been more
advanced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some subjects survive without overcoming the paralysis, so
that they simply <i>eat their heads off</i> if preserved.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> From hæmoglobinuria this disease is to be distinguished
by the history which fails to show its supervention on a
period of hard work and high feeding, followed by one or more
days of rest and then sudden exercise; by the swelling ecchymosis
and discharge from the vulva or sheath, and by the occurrence
of several cases in animals that have had an opportunity for a
common infection. In case of death the condition of the kidney,
bladder and urethra, and the marked congestion of the lumbar
portion of the cord is significant, the congestion, petechiæ and
extravasations are deeper and the glairy discharge is present.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prognosis.</i> From one-fourth to a third of the animals attacked
either die or are rendered permanently useless.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span><i>Treatment.</i> Antiseptic washes and irrigations of the genito-urinary
passages, and the adjacent parts, if employed early
enough, would tend to abort the disease. Even if resorted to
later, they would be of some value in limiting the multiplication
of the microbe and the absorption of its toxins. For this purpose
boric or salicylic acid, salicylate of soda, permanganate of
potash, or silver nitrate may be taken as examples. They
should be as thoroughly applied as possible, the bladder being
thoroughly evacuated and injected several times a day. As internal
medication, oil of turpentine and other stimulant antiseptics
that are eliminated by the kidneys might be tried in small
doses frequently repeated. Keep in slings. The patient that
cannot stand up is lost.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> This consists in isolation of the healthy, thorough
disinfection of the stalls, gutters, combs, brushes, rubbers,
blankets, and the hands of attendants. Litter used for the sick
should be burned and manure piles secluded and disinfected.
Even flies are to be dreaded, so that darkness in the stable, fly
nets, fly screens, and insect powder and other means of insect
destruction will be in order. Sponges and other means of dressing
should not be used indiscriminately on different animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> A specific fever of cattle, enzoötic during the warm
seasons in the low, malarious grounds and wooded or uncultivated
districts of different countries, caused by a protozoön in the blood
and red globules, which is conveyed from animal to animal by
ticks, and leading to engorgement of the spleen and liver, destruction
of the red globules, hæmoglobinuria, and oligocythemia.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Historic Notes.</i> This malady has doubtless existed from time
immemorial in different malarial districts of the Old World, where
the wood and moor ill is now coming to be recognized as a protozoan
tick-borne disease. The malady exists in Roumania (Starcovici,
Babes, Gavrilescu), Turkey (Nicolle, Adil-Bey), Sardinia
(San Felici, Loi), Southern France (Lignieres), Italy (Celli,
Santori), Algiers, Tunis (Lignieres), Finland (Krogins, Von
Hollens), West Indies, Mexico, Nicaragua, United States of
Columbia, South America as far south as the Argentine Republic,
German East Africa (Koch), Transvaal (Theiler), S. Australia
(Pound). In Australia imported European cattle found the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>infection waiting for them in the uncultivated bottoms. In
America it doubtless prevailed on the seaboard and islands of
the Gulf of Mexico from the time of the importation of Spanish
cattle, but for the first definite account of it we are indebted to
Dr. James Pease, who records the widespread destruction of the
native herds in Lancaster, Co., Penn., in connection with the introduction
of cattle from the south. None of the southern cattle
died, but wherever they traveled, the native stock perished all
but universally. Other droves from South Carolina were equally
destructive to all cattle along their track. The recorded symptoms
of anorexia, great weakness, often inability to stand, trembling,
groaning, bloody urine, bleeding from the nose, costiveness,
congested kidneys, and decomposed, incoagulable blood serve to
identify the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, whenever southern cattle were moved north, the disease
followed their trail. Florida cattle left infection along their
route until they reached the border of Virginia, where it usually
ceased. When taken from the Georgia mountains to the lowlands,
they died without infecting the native stock, and, when
such native stock of the lowlands were moved to the hills or the
north, they conveyed the fever to the stock among which they
came, though themselves well and improving all the time
(Wilkinson). Similar experiences were had in all the middle
states up to the war of 1861, but, in too many cases, the real source
of infection was overlooked. It was observed that the disease
was confined to the vicinity of the main highways and drove
roads running north, and spared the lands lying somewhat back
of these routes. Attention was drawn to the Texas cattle in
1853 when a herd of 450 which had wintered in Jasper Co., Mo.
moved north passing through Vernon Co. in June, and causing
losses of 50 to 90 per cent. of the native cattle along their course,
and only along that line. Such invasions occurred yearly, and in
1858 $200,000 worth of native cattle perished from this cause in
Vernon Co. alone (A. Badger). During the war (1861–64) the
cattle, in Texas especially, encreased without meeting with an
adequate market, and, on the opening of the trade once more,
they were sent north in large numbers carrying infection with
them. When Forts Smith and Gibson had been occupied by the
Union soldiers, the southern cattle poured in along the military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>road and the Kansas farmers along this route suffered severe
losses, as well as those to whom the southern cattle were finally
distributed (Bray).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> Up to 1889 the true cause of Texas fever was unknown.
It was well established that cattle brought from the lowlands
of the southern states, during the warm season, though
themselves in apparently the best of health, proved deadly to
northern cattle with which they came in contact, to those that
followed them in the same pasture during the same warm season,
and even in many cases to the mountain cattle of the south. In
the same way northern cattle, removed to the infected regions in
the south, contracted the fever and almost all perished. This
was equally true of cattle taken from the northern states to
Jamaica or other islands in the Gulf. In the winter season, after
the first severe frosts of autumn and before the last keen frosts of
spring, the southern cattle could be safely introduced into the
northern states and on this a modus vivendi, for a trade in
southern cattle in the winter only, was based.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> <i>Piroplasma bigeminum</i>: <i>Apiosoma bigeminum</i>.
(Apios pear, geminus twin). In 1888 Starcovici discovered pyriform
organisms (<i>Babesia bigeminum</i>) in the red blood globules
of Roumanian cattle suffering from hæmoglobinuria, and Babes,
after a study of the organisms, named them <i>Hœmatococcus</i>. The
following year Theobald Smith found them in the Texas fever
blood, and recognized them as protozoa (<i>Pirosoma bigeminum</i>).
Wadoleck proposed <i>Apiosoma</i>, Bonome <i>Amœbosporidia</i>, and
Patton, <i>Piroplasma</i>. The latter pointed out that <i>Pirosoma</i> was
already in use for another organism. Th. Smith’s discovery
identified Texas fever with the Roumanian hæmoglobinuria, and
stimulated the Bureau of Animal Industry to an extended research
which, in the main, elucidated the true nature of the disease.
In a long series of experiments the observers produced
the disease in healthy susceptible cattle, by injecting them, in
the warm season with the blood of sick animals, and as constantly
failed in the experimental inoculation of similar blood on
non-bovine animals such as sheep, rabbits, Guinea pigs and
pigeons. In Australia, Pound had violent fever in two injected
sheep but no pyroplasma, and their blood injected on the ox, had
no effect. In none of these latter were the blood globules invaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>by the parasite, nor were the corpuscles lessened in
number. In the affected cattle, the red cells were reduced from
the normal 7,000,000 per cubic mm. to 1,800,000 and even lower
in some cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>Piroplasma Bigeminum</i> passes through a series of forms in
the blood. Theobald Smith found in the red globule and attached
to its margin a <i>pale round body</i> 0.5μ in diameter, and staining
freely in <i>alkaline methylene blue</i> and other basic anilin dyes and
in <i>hæmatoxylin</i>, but not in acid coloring fluids. These he found
in the red globules in acute cases, often in company with the pear-shaped
bodies, and usually in the absence of the piriform bodies
in chronic cases, in non-fatal relapses, in cases occurring in cooler
weather, (late autumn or early winter) and in immune southern
cattle. The red cells containing these rounded organisms were
not crenated nor distorted, though 50 per cent. of them might
contain the parasite. He looked on these as the earlier stage of
the organism which later developed into the <i>piriform body</i>, by
segmentation of its substance. The <i>piriform</i> or <i>spindle-shaped
bodies</i> were usually found in pairs connected at their pointed ends
by a filament and extending across nearly the whole breadth of
the red globule. <i>Free microörganisms</i>, pear-shaped or round, he
failed to find in the blood of the large vessels, but saw them
only in the cardiac capillaries and especially in the kidneys.
In some cases the dim remnant of the disintegrated blood globule
could still be detected around the parasite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Laveran and Nicolle, examining the blood of Italian cases by
fixing and staining, found the two forms, round or oval, and piriform,
and claimed that the first passed into the second by segmentation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres working in Buenos Ayres with the most ample opportunity
as regards fresh material and authority to use it,
watched the successive changes in the living organisms, and
reached further conclusions. He diluted the blood with a 7 per
cent. salt solution, or with ox serum or both, until the globules
stood apart in the field. The blood can be kept under observation
for days under a cover glass luted with sterile paraffin, and
the changes clearly traced. Securing the blood from a subject
having a great abundance of infected globules (usually at the
height of the hæmoglobinuria) he found mainly the <i>piriform parasite</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>intraglobular and free, and in the latter an active whirling
motion was kept up by means of the flagellum at its pointed end.
As usually arranged in pairs (gemina), whether inside or outside
the globule, they are connected by the flagellum attached to their
pointed ends. Careful observation enables one to detect in the
pyriform mass a small brightly refrangent point like a nucleus.
In this form the piroplasma is 3 to 4μ in length.</p>

<p class='c008'>After 4 or 5 hours, and on toward the 8th, the piroplasma has
assumed the <i>round</i> or <i>oval form</i> with a small linear prolongation
(flagellum) and shrunken to 1 to 1½μ in diameter. All the
piriform bodies pass into the rounded so that this last is the
second stage of their development and not the first as was
formerly supposed. The round forms are always present in great
numbers in the cortex of the kidney in the second stage of the
disease (toward the subsidence of the hæmoglobinuria). The
refrangent nucleus is no longer to be seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>After, one, two or more days there appears in the round parasite
a <i>chromatine mass</i>, which breaks up into 2, 3, 4 or 5 smaller
<i>chromatic bodies</i>, which Lignieres considers as germs. He has
seen no division of the protoplasm, but on the contrary the germs
escape, yet remain for a time attached to the outer surface of the
parent organism. They show rapid jerking movements.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lignieres claims to have followed all these changes in the blood
kept in a sterilized glass cup at room temperature or in the thermostat,
and in the stomach of the tick, as well as on the warm
stage of the microscope.</p>

<p class='c008'>He claims to have made a further success in cultivating the
parasite in ox-blood serum highly charged with hæmoglobin. It
was only occasionally, and by the use of blood extraordinarily rich
in the parasites, that success was obtained. In one such case he
produced five successive cultures, the product being the rounded
forms only and within these the germs. There were no piriform
bodies. These are not formed outside of the red globules. The
third successive culture in this medium grew with great readiness,
producing larger parasites with less disposition to contract,
but the fourth and fifth cultures were encreasingly poor. Inoculation
with these cultures failed to produce the disease. To explain
this the doctrine of passive germs, strong for survival, but
weak pathogenically, is hazarded.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>To summarize, the successive stages of the piroplasma are:
1st. The intraglobular <i>pear-shaped bodies</i>, with flagellum often
connecting two bodies. 2nd. The <i>rounded bodies with refrangent
nucleus</i>—intraglobular or extraglobular. 3d. The <i>free round
bodies</i> with the nucleus divided into 2 to 5 <i>chromatin masses</i>. 4th.
The <i>free chromatin masses</i>, large, <i>active</i>, <i>infecting germs</i>, and
small, <i>passive</i>, <i>noninfecting germs</i>. The insuccess of inoculations
of cattle with the last-named bodies throws an air of doubt
upon them as links in the pathogenic chain. Definite information
on the antecedents, environment, food, etc., of the cattle unsuccessfully
inoculated, including the season, shelter and meteorological
conditions might have brought us a step nearer to the
full life history of the piroplasma.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The Cattle Tick</i>: <i>Boöphilus Bovis</i>: <i>Ixodes Bovis</i>: <i>I. Dugesii</i>:
<i>The Invertebrate Host of the Texas Fever Organism</i>. As early as
1868 shrewd observers had noticed that in all outbreaks of Texas
fever the affected animals were covered with ticks, and drew the
natural inference that the disease was due to the bites of these insects.
But the prevalence of ticks in localities where the disease
was unknown served to draw attention away from the important
fact that was suggestive of the true explanation of the disease.
The truth, however, constantly obtruded itself that casual cases
were never found in the absence of the tick. Finally, in 1889,
Kilborne conceived the idea of putting the matter to the test, and
with the approval of the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry,
set aside special paddocks for this purpose. Five native cattle
were placed, at midsummer, with three South Carolina cattle,
from which all ticks had been carefully picked, and they completely
escaped infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>After seventy-one days, on September 6th, when the hottest
weather had passed, two were turned into a lot with four South
Carolina cattle of the original herd which had stocked the pasture
with ticks. Of the two one died of Texas fever, September 20th,
and the other sickened in the last week of September, and had a
relapse in October, but finally recovered. Of eleven other native
cattle placed in this tick-infested field up to September 30th, ten
sickened and one escaped. One animal placed in the field October
19th escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again three North Carolina cattle and three natives were placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>in a field September 14th and 15th. The new generation of ticks
was retarded by the cool season, so that few larvæ appeared on
the native stock yet one of the three sickened.</p>

<p class='c008'>These results were confirmed by a series of other similar experiments.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a further experiment, September 13th, thousands of ticks,
mostly mature, from North Carolina, were scattered over a second
lot and four native cattle turned into it next day. Three sickened
and one, to outward appearance, escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>These results were corroborated by experiments made in succeeding
years. In addition the disease was produced regularly
in native stock by placing on their skin the six-legged larvæ of
boöphilus bovis, which had been hatched in glass vessels in the
laboratory. It was also shown that the Washington winter destroyed
the ticks in infected pastures so that native cattle could
be safely turned on them the following spring or summer.</p>

<p class='c008'>To summarize:—</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The blood of southern cattle containing the piroplasma produced
the disease when injected into a healthy susceptible animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The animal with piroplasma in its blood, did not convey the
disease, in the absence of ticks, to a susceptible animal kept with
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The animal with piroplasma in its blood and covered with
ticks conveyed the disease to a susceptible animal kept with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The ticks hatched and raised in glass vessels in the laboratory,
when put on susceptible animals, infected them.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Ticks taken from cattle harboring the piroplasma, and put
on the skin of susceptible animals, or on their pastures in the
warm season, infected the exposed stock.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. The six-legged larvæ developed in the laboratory from the
eggs of mature ticks, taken from cattle having the piroplasma,
conveyed the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. On bare pastures as far south as Washington the winter
frosts destroyed the ticks so as to render the pastures safe on the
following season.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Ticks artificially raised in a warm laboratory, produced the
disease when placed on susceptible cattle in a warmed stable
(65° to 80° F.) in winter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>9. In the Gulf states, in stables which the cattle occupy constantly
or enter twice daily for milking or feeding, the ticks may
live through the entire winter. The same has occurred in the
warm swill stables in the north.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. When taken into a new locality, it is rarely the mature
ovigerous ticks that bite and infect the native cattle of the place,
but the next generation of larvæ, so that time must be allowed
for the laying and hatching of ova.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. Ovipositing usually occupies about a week, while hatching
varies with the temperature from two to six weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. Cases can be adduced in which native cattle followed, on
the same pasture, the tick-bearing infecting cattle, and remained
for a week or more, and yet escaped, the larvæ being as yet unhatched
from the ova. Other native cattle, following these two
or three weeks later, perished almost without exception.</p>

<p class='c008'>13. This delay in the hatching may be indefinitely prolonged,
and thus in the southern states, the winter may be tided over,
without the loss of vitality in the ova, especially if it is covered
by leaves, moss, wood, or decaying vegetable matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>14. When dealing with lung plague in Chicago in 1888, I
noted the facts that every cow that entered a city stable through
the stock yards during the dry, hot, midsummer weather died of
Texas fever within a month, while those that passed through
the same yards during a particular rainy week, all escaped.
Berkau has shown that, in the absence of the coating of the
glutinous saliva, the eggs do not hatch, and here we may assume
that this covering was washed off by the rains and the eggs
perished.</p>

<p class='c008'>15. It has long been noticed that the ticks are scarcely at all
dangerous to young calves living on milk. This applies not only
to calves born of cows native to infected localities, and therefore
possibly having a congenital immunity, but also to the calves
of northern and susceptible cows, and which were exposed
simultaneously with their dams. It suggests a special defensive
power in even the bovine system when sustained on animal food.
In the Bureau of Animal Industry experiments, calves of four
months, already using vegetable food freely, sickened but still,
as a rule, recovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>16. The Bureau fed three cattle with adult live ticks (2000 to
one animal) but no infection resulted.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>17. Four cattle were injected intravenously with the liquid
charged by crushing ticks in a mortar with distilled water. In
some cases the liquid was put through a Pasteur filter, in others
only through two thicknesses of filter paper. No infection
ensued.</p>

<p class='c008'>18. Lignieres injected, subcutem, in different animals the pulp
of the ticks at all stages of life, ground in a mortar with distilled
water, but found in no case tristeza as the result nor any destruction
of red globules.</p>

<p class='c008'>The apparent paradox involved in the last three items probably
finds its explanation in the statement of Nicolle and Adil-Bey
that, in biting, the tick instils into the wound a venomous saliva
which causes local congestion and infiltration and presumably
operates on the blood globules as well. Curtice describes the two
racemose glands situated under the head shield, the secretions of
which are pressed out by the movements of the mouth ring and
appendages. How much of this irritant and toxic action is inherent
in the saliva, and how much due to the protozoan contained
in it, has not been shown. Nicolle, Adil-Bey and, later,
Lignieres showed a similar toxic property in the blood. Three
to five cc. of blood taken from an acute case at the crisis and injected
into the marginal vein of the ear in a rabbit, killed the subject
in a few seconds. A similar amount thrown into the peritoneum
of a Guinea pig destroyed life in a few minutes. It is
probable that the dilution of the venom in the mass of tick pulp
and distilled water reduced its toxic quality to such a low ebb
that the red globules were comparatively unaffected by it and
successfully resisted the attacks of the microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The name <i>Boöphilus bovis</i> was given to the bearer of the Piroplasma
by Cooper Curtice who made a special study of the tick,
and its development. For the description see <i>Parasites, Ixodes</i>.
Among the most marked and distinctive features of the female
are the extreme shortness and relative breadth of the rostrum,
the slender palpi, the eight rows of spines on the lower surface of
the labium, the smooth mandibles with terminal hooks, the limbs
long, slender, in seven segments, and each furnished with a
terminal pad (pulvillus) and one hook (fore limbs) or two hooks
(hind). Curtice has identified the ticks of hæmoglobinuria in
various other countries with the boöphilus. The <i>Garrapata</i> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>Mexico and the West Indies, the Hæmaphysalis rosea of Cuba
(Koch), the Ixodes Annulata of Florida (Say), the Ixodes
Dugesii of Italy (Nequin), the Ixodes Algeriensis and the Ixodes
Egypti he found to be identical. There may be some doubt as
to the Rhipicephalus Annulatus Microplus of Buenos Ayres, but
as it agrees with the boöphilus in size, in the thickness of its rostrum,
in the eight rows of hooks on the lower surface of the
labium, in its host and habits, in the fact that it transfers the
piroplasma to cattle, and that it prevails on the same continent in
what were formerly colonies of Spain it is in all probability the
same tick. Curtice holds that it was originally a North African
tick, which was carried by the Spaniards to their American
colonies. The Rhipicephalus Annulatus of Roumania is probably
the same, together with the ticks that convey the Piroplasma in
the other countries of Europe. There remain the Hæmaphysalis
of South Africa and the “Scrub-tick” of Australia to be identified
with, or differentiated from the Boöphilus. The life history
of the Queensland “scrub” tick coincides with that of the
boöphilus of America (Pound). As Australia derived her cattle
from Britain it is improbable that the tick was imported from
Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> If the course of the disease has been short, followed
by an early death, the carcass may be full and rounded, but if the
animal has been sick for five or six days there is marked loss of
condition and weight—emaciation. As after any other affection occurring
during very hot weather, decomposition sets in early, though
not quite so speedily as in anthrax, in which the subject dies full
of rich blood. Something, too, depends on the condition at
death, putrefaction being manifestly slower in protracted and debilitated
cases. The color of the skin, the mucosæ and normally
white tissues varies in the same way. As it has been largely
seen in our northern States (and Australia) in fat cattle, which
contracted the disease in railway cars, cattle markets, or dealers’
or butchers’ parks, etc., the deep orange hue of the white tissues
is one of the most marked features, and even the muscles have a
deep mahogany yellow hue. In poor milch cows and stock cattle
in the South, on the other hand, the icteric hue is often conspicuous
by its absence. Cattle killed early for experimental purposes
may also show less icterus. The color appears to be influenced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>largely by the abundance of red globules in the blood when
the animal was attacked, by the rapid destruction of these
globules, and the saturation of the blood and tissues with hæmoglobin
in solution. The presence of ticks on the skin, especially
along the ventral aspect, inside of the thighs, on the scrotum,
udder or perineum, sufficiently explains the number of minute
infiltrations into the derma, the oozing of blood or serum, and the
matting of the hairs into little tufts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>pale, watery condition of the blood</i> was recognized as one of
the most constant features in 1868, together with the disappearance
of the red globules. The clot is remarkably soft and, at the
crisis of the disease, the serum is of a reddish hue by reason of
the hæmoglobin in solution. When, however, the urine is no
longer stained, the hæmoglobin having been eliminated, the
serum assumes its normal pale amber hue. For the first counting
of the red globules in this disease we are indebted to the Bureau
of Animal Industry. The average count in healthy cattle approximated
to 6,000,000 per mm. of blood, and in three days this
would descend to 4,000,000, 3,000,000, 2,000,000 or even 1,183,000.
The rates of decrease was ⅛ to ⅙ of the entire number in
one day. In case of recovery the repair of the red globules was
slow, from one to two months being required to bring them up to
the normal standard. Lignieres claims recoveries after the count
had gone as low as 300,000 per mm., and in fatal cases, a few
hours before death, it may be but 31,000 per mm.</p>

<p class='c008'>In high conditioned animals, with high fever often aggravated
by travel, the muscles may be dark and firm, but in those out of
condition and in the advanced anæmic stages of the disease the
muscles are pale, and there may be subcutaneous œdema below
the chest and belly. These last features are especially noted by
Smith and Kilborne.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>lungs</i> are usually normal. Sometimes limited congestions,
punctiform petechiæ, emphysema and small areas of œdema or
hepatization are noticed (Smith and Kilborne).</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>pericardium</i> contains a little bloody serum and is marked
by petechiæ.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>left heart</i> is usually empty, but the <i>right heart</i> full of fluid,
or later, of clotted blood, in the latter case without buffy coat.
The endocardium, and especially on the musculi papillares, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>marked by petechiæ, punctuate or in considerable patches. The
cardiac capillaries are full of blood, with numerous piroplasmata.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>peritoneum</i> often contains a little reddish serosity, and a
slight gelatinoid exudation is sometimes found around the kidneys
or elsewhere in the abdomen. Petechiæ are frequent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>stomachs</i> usually show petechiated spots on the mucous membranes,
and more or less diffuse congestion. Sloughing of
the mucosa at such points is not uncommon, and even perforation
of the folds of the third and fourth stomachs. The Bureau of
Animal Industry and Lignieres both found these stomach lesions
very inconsiderable. The smaller pinhead erosions described by
Gamgee were identified by the Bureau of Animal Industry as bites
of the strongylus convolutus. The <i>small intestines</i> are usually
moderately congested.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>cæcum</i> and <i>colon</i> show more congestion, becoming at times
of a deep red or almost black hue, and considerable extravasation
of blood may take place. This is especially marked in the
rectum, which may be of a port wine hue, comparable to that
seen in rinderpest or hæmorrhoidal anthrax. The fæces are
often dry and massed in balls in cæcum and rectum, while if
diarrhœa has set in, the discharges may be colored with blood or
blood elements. Yet in the cases reported by the Bureau serious
lesions of the intestines were rather the exception, and some subjects
showed scarcely any lesion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>liver</i> is usually enlarged, averaging three to five pounds
heavier than in a healthy ox of the same weight. In these enlarged
and congested cases it is of a deep yellowish brown color,
and often shows yellow spots on the darker ground. Microscopically
each acinus has a bright yellow centre from which yellow
radiating canals diverge to join the peripheral gall duct. In the
superficial or portal portion of the acinus, the hepatic cells are
granular from fatty change, yet the nucleus is usually still
recognizable. Toward the central zone it may have disappeared.
The further this has advanced, the softer, the more easily pitted
and the more friable the liver. The congestion of these radical
gall ducts with the dense colored bile, displays the structure of
the acini in a clear and beautiful way, which no injection can accomplish.
When the affected tissue is teased out and placed under
the microscope the inspissated contents of the bile canaliculi may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>be seen as yellow cylindroid casts sometimes bifurcated to represent
the union of the two canals. If stained in Ehrlich’s acid
hæmatoxylin, the necrotic elements refuse to take the stain so
that the contrast between the dead and the living tissues is enhanced.
Fatty degeneration is common in the liver of healthy
beef cattle so that this is less significant than the congestion of
the acini, and the phenomenal distension of the radical gall ducts
with inspissated bile.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>gall bladder</i> is usually full (½ pint to 1 quart or more),
and its mucous membrane congested and sometimes petechiated.
The <i>bile</i> is thick and viscid, like tar, it may be yellowish green,
darkening on exposure and contains hæmatoidin crystals and
abundance of flocculi showing bright yellow or orange by transmitted
light and reddish brown by reflected light.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>spleen</i> is always enlarged, often enormously so. From an
average weight of 1.5 lb. to 1.7 lb. for a 1000 lbs. ox, it will rise
to 2, 7 or even 10 lbs. One measured 27 inches long by 7½
inches wide and in the centre 3 inches thick (Rauch). Even in
apparent health the Gulf coast cattle have spleens averaging
about 2½ lbs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spleen is gorged with blood which appears purple as seen
through the stretched and attenuated capsule, and darker petechial
spots are found at intervals. When cut into, the pulp alone
appears dark, brownish red, grumous, and showing under the
microscope many red blood cells, larger cells granular and undergoing
fatty degeneration, yellow flocculi, crystals of hæmatoidin,
and granules of black pigment. It is the excess rather than the
nature of these agents that is significant. The pulp may be
pressed or washed out, bringing the trabeculæ and Malphigian
bodies into view.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>kidneys</i> are most seriously affected in acute and rapidly
fatal cases. There may be œdema, with blood staining and even
extravasation on their lower surface and in the adipose tissue.
The gland may be enlarged and the cortical substance congested
of a dark brownish red or black. Its capillaries are gorged with
red globules in which the piroplasmata are very numerous. The
medullary portion is much paler, and with fatty granules in the
epithelium, and oil globules in the tubules. The renal pelvis is
more or less petechiated and marked by extravasations.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>The <i>bladder</i> is marked by petechiæ and usually contains some
quarts of urine more or less deeply stained with hæmoglobin.
The depth of color is in exact ratio with the extent and rapidity
of the destruction of red globules, and of the elimination of their
coloring matter. When the destruction is proceeding rapidly the
urine may be as dark as port wine; when their disintegration has
lessened it may be pale though the temperature is still high (105°
F.) In slight and tardy cases there is reason to believe that the
redness of the urine may be omitted altogether as is the icteric
discoloration of the mucosæ, and hence cases seen in animals indigenous
to the protozoan fever districts, have been described as a
distinct disease. In these mild cases and advanced stages there
is usually a certain amount of albuminuria remaining. In the
early stages the urine is strongly alkaline, effervesces with acids,
and has a high specific gravity (1030–1040); later when abstinence
and suspended digestion and assimilation causes the patient to
subsist on its own tissues the reaction may become distinctly acid
and the specific gravity reduced (1010–1020). It no longer effervesces.
During convalescence while there is a great deficiency of
red globules and other blood solids, the urine tends to become
pale and watery, of a low specific gravity, and lacking in even its
normal pigments.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>womb</i> will at times show petechiæ and in pregnant cows
the fœtus will show sero-sanguineous effusions or even extravasations
in the chest or abdomen, and hæmoglobinuria (Lignieres).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> Outbreaks occurring in the North, in herds into
which southern infected cattle have been brought, were at first
held to indicate an incubation of thirty or forty days (or even
sometimes sixty-five), but this is now explained by the time required
for the laying and hatching of the eggs of the mature
ticks and the evolution of infecting young larval or seed ticks.
The actual incubation, as shown by the subcutaneous or intravenous
injection of the blood of an infected ox, extends from
three to ten days. The hyperthermia is usually shown on the
third day, and the more manifest outward symptoms on the sixth.
Extreme heat of the weather, a special susceptibility of the animal
infected, and especially a large dose of the blood and protozoa
will hasten somewhat the onset, but three to six days may be
set down as the rule after the ticks have introduced the parasite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>into their victim. Cattle taken from the northern states and
placed on southern pastures, or passing over trails already well
stocked with the ticks, are infected at once and sicken in from
three to ten days. Cattle in their northern home placed on a
previously uninfested field with southern cattle just arrived, do
not suffer for thirty, forty, sixty, and in exceptional cases, even
ninety days. The paradox is explained by the time wanted for
the laying of the eggs and the hatching of the tick larvæ. The
female tick does not lay eggs until she is fully mature, and if the
ticks on a southern ox are still immature there is a variable
period of delay until the eggs are mature enough to be deposited.
Then the ovigerous tick drops off her host and spends one week
in laying her eggs. In warm weather these eggs take three to
four weeks to hatch, so that usually five weeks elapse before the
young (seed ticks) can climb upon the ox and infect him. Add
three to six days more for the actual incubation and we account
for about six weeks of delay in the appearance of the
disease in northern cattle. If we consider further that a wet season
occurring after the eggs have been laid and before they are
hatched tends to divest them of their protective covering and to
expose them to destruction, and that, in any case, a cold season
will delay the hatching until the recurrence of warm weather,
and that the absence of bovine victims will doom the new-born
larva to an arrest of development, so that a further indefinite delay
may be entailed, we have abundant explanation of the frequently
delayed evolution of symptoms. Yet in general terms
the apparent prolongation of incubation is due to fortuitous circumstances
which delay the infection, and not to any actual extension
of the incubation itself.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of Acute Type.</i> Cattle infected outside the area of
habitual prevalence and stock from noninfected districts, conveyed
into the infected ones in hot weather, usually contract the
disease in its acute and fatal form. The period of the year is
often significant, a number of animals being attacked at once in
the hot dry period of late summer or autumn—July to September
in North America, February to May in Argentina.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first symptom is a rise of temperature, and this may last
two or even three days before other morbid phenomena are
noticed. It may rise to 104° F. in the first day and later to 107°,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>108° or 109°. The more acute the case and the hotter the
weather the greater the rise. The highest records are obtained
late in the day, the lowest in the morning. The temperature
often rises for two to four days, and then suddenly drops with the
occurrence of collapse and imminent death. While the thermometer
is of the highest value in taking the temperature, yet the
extraordinary hyperthermia is easily detected by grasping the root
of the horn or ear, or by feeling the nose, feet, anus or lips of the
vulva.</p>

<p class='c008'>After 2 or 3 days the respirations become accelerated to 60 to
100 per minute, and the pulse to 90 to 100 or more. There is complete
loss of appetite and rumination after the development of
these symptoms, the mouth is hot and it may be dry, the muzzle
dry, the head pendent, the eyes dull or semiclosed and congested
(usually icteric), the bowels confined, to be relaxed again as the
fever subsides. A disposition to stand or lie down in water has
been frequently noted. Nervous symptoms are usually present.
The extreme dulness, languor, and apathy, the drooping head
and ears, the unsteadiness of the support the animal staggering
or propping himself up by spreading all four limbs, and the
tendency to assume and retain a recumbent position, are marked
phenomena in our domesticated northern cattle. The paresis
may absolutely incapacitate the animal from getting up. In our
wilder range cattle it may show itself in active delirium and
Lignieres notes the same of the Pampas cattle in Argentina. The
animal lying dull and apathetic (triste), on being approached
may raise his head, open his eyes and glare threateningly at the intruder.
Sometimes when trembling violently, and swaying ready
to fall, he will marshal all his remaining energy to plunge at a
man on foot or mounted. Some have become blind and unconsciously
walked against obstacles, others have been noticed to run
in wide circles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The milk secretion is suppressed, any little that can be drawn
in the advanced stages having a thick, creamy appearance.
Abortion is common in the pregnant cow.</p>

<p class='c008'>The condition of the urine has, however, always drawn
especial attention and the names <i>red-water</i> and <i>hœmoglobinuria</i>
have accordingly been largely applied to the disease. When, in
infected areas, the milder types of the disease have failed to show
<i>red-water</i> (Jamaica), the identity of the affection with Texas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>fever has even been denied. Shortly after the rise of temperature,
the urine becomes turbid, and this gradually encreases to a
more or less deep red. It assumes its darkest hue when the destruction
of red globules is most active and during convalescence
it disappears. The suppression of urinary secretion may account
in some cases for the absence of this symptom even at the crisis
of the fever, yet, as a rule, it is present at such time, and, even
though it may have escaped notice during life, the <i>red-water</i> is
found in the bladder at the necropsy. It may be of all grades,
from the merest tinge of redness to a reddish brown, coffee-grounds,
or blackish aspect. The coloration is not due to red
globules, but to the hæmoglobin which has escaped from the disintegrating
globules, and been eliminated by the kidneys. It is
always associated with albumen, and, in the advanced stages and
during convalescence, when the elimination of hæmoglobin has
ceased, that of albumen continues in small amount for weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thin, watery appearance of the blood when the disease has
reached its height, is constant and even more characteristic than
the <i>red-water</i>. A single drop drawn from the skin will show to
the naked eye the pale, thin, transparent appearance, but examination
under the microscope will confirm this. It remains,
too, for a length of time, being recognizable for a month in cases
of recovery. In connection with the watery blood, the mucosæ
and the muzzle (if naturally white) assume a pallid aspect. This
is best marked in the absence of icterus, yet even with the yellow
discoloration, the absence of ramifying red vessels is very characteristic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bowels are at first constipated and the fæces passed in
small, hard balls. Later they may assume a reddish brown or
chocolate color, and a covering of mucus and fine blood clots. Diarrhœa
supervenes in some cases. In passing the fæces, the
everted mucosa usually shows a dark red color.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Course and Duration.</i> Acute cases, above all if traveled or
otherwise excited, may terminate in death in 24 to 48 hours.
More commonly death will take place in 4 to 7 days. Some
patients survive longer, but owing to the extraordinary loss of
blood globules and the lesions of important solid tissues they are
unable to rally, become steadily weaker and perish in from two
weeks to three months. Such animals are pale and bloodless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>weak on their limbs, careless of food, and encreasingly emaciated.
The pulse is weak and irritable and the eyes sunken. The temperature
becomes normal or nearly so, soon after the suspension
of the hæmoglobinuria. In cases of recovery there remains for
a month or more an unnatural pallor, with marked loss of condition
and weakness which are only gradually overcome. Convalescent
animals are liable to die of indigestion when overfed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>mortality</i> averages not less than 90 per cent. in susceptible
mature cattle from a healthy district in the hot season. Later,
from October onward, the tendency is to a milder type of disease
and a greater ratio of recoveries.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms of the Mild Type.</i> This is seen mainly in cattle indigenous
to the Texas fever district, in sucking calves, and in
mature cattle from healthy districts but attacked during the cool
or winter season. It can be produced at will by placing a limited
number of ticks (5 to 20) on the skin of susceptible cattle,
especially in the cool season. Again, it occurs as a relapse in
cattle that have survived an attack earlier in the season.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though there are all gradations from the violent type, yet we
may set down as mild all cases in which the temperature does not
rise above 105° F., running frequently about 103° F. There is
loss of appetite, dulness, languor, costiveness, scanty urine, albuminous
but not hæmoglobinuric, pallor of the mucosæ, and
marked loss of condition. Examination of the blood shows the
presence of the parasite in the red globules but usually in the
coccus or round form only, and the destruction and disappearance
of the globules is much less marked so that, though the blood is
anæmic and watery, it is not nearly so much so as in the violent
and fatal cases. Without the examination of the blood it may be
impossible to distinguish these cases from other febrile affections,
yet occurring as they do in the infected district in a number of
animals at once, in the cooler season, and showing albuminuria,
and marked anæmic symptoms, they should lead to suspicion
and a search for the boöphilus on the skin, and the oligocythemia
and the protozoa in the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Differential Diagnosis from Anthrax.</i> As anthrax is the one
disease with which Texas fever is most likely to be confounded,
it may be profitable to collect in tabular form their differential
features:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> Up to the present medical treatment has been
essentially unsatisfactory. Lignieres gave quinia sulphate in
large doses by the mouth, and in doses of 2½ drams subcutem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>daily, before and during infection without any visible effect on
the progress of the disease. Methylene blue to (¾ to 1¼ dr.),
salicylate of soda (7½ drs. daily), arsenious acid (1¼ dr. daily),
cacodylate of soda (7½ grs. subcutem) were also tried with no
good result. The Metropolitan Board of Health, New York,
claimed a succession of recoveries under the use of carbolic acid
in the drinking water and sprinkled on the ground so that the
animals inhaled it. The cases were, however, the survivors after
the first and more acute cases had perished, and the results no
doubt depended largely on the mildness of the attacks. The same
agent in other hands has not been equally successful. A large
number of other agents have been used in vain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the most important measures are a laxative food, like
flax seed gruel, a careful picking of all ticks from the surface, the
washing of the skin with a 5 per cent solution of creolin, and the
removal of the animals to a tick-free pasture, lot, or building.
This at once arrests the introduction into the blood of fresh and
continuous accessions of the pyroplasma and, if begun early
enough, will determine a mild and non-fatal case.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> The prevention of the protozoan cattle fever is
based on the life history of the parasite, and may be directed
(1st) to the <i>destruction of the Boöphilus Bovis</i>; or (2nd) to <i>encreasing
the resisting power of the exposed animal, to the Piroplasma
Bigeminum. 1st. Destruction of the Ticks. (a) On the cattle.</i>
The <i>picking of ticks from the skin</i> is effective if the object is to
make the animal safe for a few days only as the boöphilus habitually
clings to the skin of the one ox from the stage of seed tick to
that of ovigerous female, ready to drop off and lay its eggs. An
animal going direct to slaughter may therefore be sent through an
uninfested district, even in the hot season with a fair amount of
safety, after the careful gleaning of the ticks. The greatest care,
however, must be taken to manipulate thoroughly all parts of the
skin and above all, the ventral aspect, the inner sides of the limbs,
the scrotum, udder and perineum. The animals must be shipped
at once after such gleaning of ticks with no further opportunity of
taking on a new supply, the cars and other conveyances must be
cleaned and treated with acaricides and the litter burned as soon
as they are vacated, and the cattle must be passed over no loading
banks, chutes nor yards that may by any possibility be used for
other cattle unless these are going into slaughter house.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>The picking will safely remove all the larger larvæ, and the
mature ticks which are ready to lay their eggs, but it cannot be
implicitly trusted to remove also the all but invisible embryos
or seed ticks, and if the host is preserved these grow up and
mature, while if they are accidentally dropped or brushed from
the surface, they climb upon the first available ox and mature on
that. By passing from ox to ox they may be kept alive for a
time in the pens adjoining the slaughter house, but fortunately
they do not travel over a few feet and if no cattle escape from
such pens there is small risk of their preservation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dipping</i> or <i>smearing</i> to destroy the seed ticks on the skin becomes
an essential adjunct to, or substitute for, picking. The
Bureau of Animal Industry has experimented largely on dips
with most important and valuable results, even if they have
proved only in a measure successful and desirable. Aqueous
dips they early discarded. Poisonous agents like corrosive sublimate
and arsenic are liable to poison through absorption and
licking, with the added drawback that neither these nor calcium
sulphide are at all effective in destroying the ticks. Proprietary
sheep dips were abandoned on similar grounds. Baths of cotton
seed oil were introduced by Francis, but proved not quite effective
even when phenic acid, benzine, gasoline, or different mineral
oils were added. <i>Paraffin oil</i> gave the best results, and later a
staple sold as <i>extra dynamo oil</i>, which in combination with <i>sulphur</i>
(1:100) proved most destructive to the ticks, was adopted.
But in the hot season, when such dipping is required, any one of
these baths produced <i>heating</i>, and illness in the cattle, and
together with the exertion and excitement served to rouse into
dangerous activity the germs already present in the blood. Ophthalmia,
too, was a very frequent result. If the cattle could be
kept on their native pastures the dipping might be permissible,
but this was to lose the object aimed at—the wholesomeness of
these cattle on uninfected ranges. When shipped north in the
hot weather the losses were so great as to be prohibitory.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, however, it could be reserved for use on the southern pastures,
to prevent the maturing of the ticks and the laying of eggs
for a future generation, it might be employed to rid the infested
pastures of the boöphilus, and consequently of infection. The
question, then, is reduced to the comparative advantage of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>destruction of the ticks, on the one hand, and the cost of frequent
dipping throughout the warm season, on the other. The following
season there ought to be no ticks left.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cooper Curtice advocates kerosene 1 gallon in combination
with an equal amount of lard, 1 lb. sulphur, and 2 lbs. pine tar.
Melt the lard, add the sulphur and tar, bring to the boiling point,
cool, add the kerosene with stirring. Rub daily with a brush on
the whole skin but especially inside the arms and thighs. On
tick-infested pastures it must be continued through the season,
and if thoroughly done will leave the fields tick-free the following
year. Like oil dipping it would manifestly be incompatible
with immediate shipment on a long railway journey, but Curtice
vouches for its efficacy as a means of eliminating ticks from
southern pastures. The main question is the expense. What
would be perfectly adapted to small herds of very domesticated
cattle in North Carolina would be a herculean and expensive task
in the large herds of Texas. Curtice mentions cotton seed oil,
fish oil and even a small proportion of linseed oil as good substitutes
for the lard.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Destruction of Ticks on Pastures.</i> Fields, farms and larger
areas can be freed from the boöphilus by the thorough application
to the cattle pastured on them of one of the above-described
methods, provided that no strange cattle are admitted on the land.
The ticks are sluggish and, unless carried on the bodies of animals,
do not crawl many feet from where they drop. If cattle
are kept in the next lot, they should not be allowed to come in
contact with the treated or protected stock, but a double fence
with an interval of five or six feet, will prove a sufficient barrier
to the advances of the tick, apart from its bovine host.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cultivation</i> of a tick-infested soil for one year or more, with
complete exclusion of cattle from November or December until
March or April of the second year thereafter, will exterminate
the ticks. During the intervening summer there may be plenty
of young live ticks on this land, but, in the absence of the bovine
host, and blood, these cannot reach maturity, lay their eggs and
thus leave new generations. In the course of the second winter
therefore they are exterminated. In restocking such land, it is
all important to see that the cattle placed upon it do not introduce
any ticks on their bodies. Equally essential is it, to see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>cattle are excluded from the cultivated land in winter as well as
in summer. During warm days ovigerous female ticks, dropped
from the skins of such cattle, may produce eggs and larvæ to
start a new crop in the coming summer. But as has happened
to the wood ticks of the North, so in the South, cultivation of
the soil and the exclusion of cattle for a length of time, will exterminate
the race of ixodes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Exclusion of cattle for two winters and the intervening summer</i>
will eradicate the ticks even in the absence of cultivated crops.
To reach full maturity and propagate its kind, the tick must
have bovine blood. If therefore the ticks of a whole season
(spring, summer and autumn) are denied bovine victims, and
thus cut short in their development, no crop is left for the succeeding
spring. If then a cattle pasture is divided in two parts
by a double fence with an intervening space of 5 or 6 feet, and if
the cattle are confined to one of these parts for a whole year and
are transferred to the second half in January after dipping or
smearing with ixodicide oil they may be kept entirely free from
ticks thereafter. That half of the pasture which is abandoned
in the second year, will be tick-free and salubrious in the third
year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another resort, advised by Curtice when a large tick-free pasture
is available, is to place the infected cattle in a pen, and <i>soil</i>
them for three weeks, no longer. Then transfer them to another
clean pen and <i>soil</i> them there for three weeks more. Then examine
closely, and if entirely free from ticks they can be put in
the large clean pasture. Should they still carry a few ticks they
should be placed in a third clean pen for two weeks more, when
they will be tick-free and may be turned into the large pasture
without the formality of examination. This is substantially
based on the period of parasitism of the tick on the skin of the
ox, and its development from the newly hatched larva (seed tick),
to the ovigerous female. This period is from three to four weeks.
The greater number of the ticks are therefore dropped off as
mature ticks to lay their eggs in the first pen, while the remainder
are similarly left in the second pen. As the stock leaves the
two pens in succession long before the deposited eggs have had
time to hatch out, they can take on no more ticks and emerge
from the second pen clear and safe. The same pens cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>used repeatedly, as the eggs develop into seed ticks in 15 days in
hot weather, and at once attack cattle.</p>

<p class='c008'>A stockowner who, independently of his fellows, adopts one of
the above expedients in an infested district, is however confronted
by the risk of the infection of his herd, by the accidental
or careless contact of his cattle with outside ones, and especially
with the places where they have been. A broken fence and the
entrance of tick infested cattle, or the escape of his tick-free
cattle into infested lands, will be the death warrant of all that
have not been previously exposed to the disease. Another consideration
is that this rigid seclusion of the protected herd must
be continued indefinitely so long as ticks are maintained anywhere
in the district. The protected animals cannot be driven over a
highway without exposing them to almost certain death. Even
if a group of adjacent stockowners agree to purify their respective
farms, they cannot debar their less careful neighbors from using
the highways for tick-infected stock, nor from turning such out
on adjoining fields. The veriest scrubs, admitted to the highways,
woods and unfenced grounds, keep up the general diffusion
of the fever germ and its tick bearer and undo the best directed
efforts of any combination of owners of high class and
valuable stock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well directed legislation, excluding cattle for one or two years,
from all woods and unenclosed lands, and enforcing some one of
the available methods for the clearing of fenced and stocked lands
(cultivation, pasturage by cattle on alternate years, frequent dipping
or smearing, passing the stock through a succession of pens),
could be made to put an end for all time to the obnoxious tick.
If even some other than bovine animals should be discovered to
harbor the boöphilus and pyroplasma it could be included in the
prohibition and the work made complete. The results would far
more than compensate for any necessary outlay. Illinois, with
55,414 square miles of area has over 3,000,000 cattle. The coast
states from Virginia to Texas, with Arkansas, Indian Territory
and Oklahoma, amount to 767,215 square miles, and in the same
ratio should sustain 43,340,040 head. A stock of 25,000,000 at
$20 per head would amount to a capital of $500,000,000. Immune
from the pyroplasma these cattle would draw freely on the
best blood of the north and under the milder skies would compete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>with the northern cattle on more than equal terms. Living in
the open air, they would in the main escape tuberculosis and the
other stable-propagated diseases of the north, and their dairy and
beef products would enter the market free from suspicion, and
command a readier sale, if not a higher price. The stock themselves
could be moved to northern markets at all seasons without
restriction, and escape the serious losses that now come from a
sudden transfer, while pyroplasma-infected and susceptible, to the
violent excitement of travel, and the frost-bound destination.
Their owners could watch the markets and sell in the best, in
place of being compelled, as at present, to hurry them in during
November and December, and to sell often at a ruinous sacrifice.
With the extinction of the boöphilus the present unrestricted
pasturage and all other privileges now enjoyed would return,
freighted with a value never borne before, and the few Southern
cattle and cattle products need fear no competition in the markets
of the world, and could no longer be justly subjected to any
restriction.</p>

<p class='c008'>There would remain the constant danger of the introduction of
the boöphilus anew from Mexico, the West Indian Islands and
the Central and South American States, where in the absence of
frosts the boöphilus cannot be extirpated in the same way, and
here accordingly all importation must be forbidden. Cattle from
Southern Florida and from islands on our Southern Coast may
demand a similar exclusion. There is too much at stake to permit
any laxity, and no infected area should be allowed to send
out its cattle until it has been abundantly well proved that such
district or State is absolutely tick-free.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d. <i>Immunization: Encreasing the Resistance to the Piroplasma
Bigeminum.</i> That cattle can be fortified to resist the attacks of
the piroplasma is shown in the immunity possessed by the indigenous
herds generally, in the regions infested with this parasite
and the boöphilus. To begin with, there may be a survival
of the fittest, the more susceptible strains of blood having been
long ago cut off. But the immune southern cattle if kept for
years outside of the infested area and then returned to it, suffer a
mortality about as great as that of northern cattle in the same
circumstances. Their earlier immunity, therefore, is not merely
a racial difference, but must be due in greatest part to an acquired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>resistance, and further, this resistance is not permanent but must
be renewed at short intervals. The immunity may be in part acquired
in the womb of the infested dam, in the last months of
gestation, but it is chiefly post-natal through the attacks of the
ticks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>a. Infection of sucking calf.</i> The indigenous cattle acquire
immunity mainly through the attacks of the boöphilus, in the
first month or two when they are still on an exclusively milk
diet, that renders the piroplasma practically harmless. Following
a parallel method, calves, living on milk alone, can be taken into
the infected regions and exposed to the attacks of the ticks with
safety, and with the result of protection for the future. Escaping
the first invasion, they continue to harbor as many ticks summer
after summer, as will reinforce yearly their acquired power of resistance,
so that they continue measurably safe though spending
the life in the area of the infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Francis and Connoway applied this to Jersey calves of two to
six weeks old applying to each 25 to 50 ticks. It led to slight
hyperthermia, some dulness and inappetence, but on recovery
they all gained flesh and condition. Two died from exposure but
necropsy showed no sign of Texas fever. The following summer
all were infested with 200 to 500 ticks apiece but not one sickened
in consequence. These were Jersey calves (the least susceptible
breed) and the experiments were made in cool weather in autumn.
The limitation of the practice to the cool fall or winter months
renders the operation much more safe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>b. Infecting Older Animals by a limited number of Ticks.</i>
Yearling Jerseys, Holsteins and Shorthorn were subjected to 25
to 50 ticks in July, they showed only slight rise of temperature,
and later resisted the free exposure to tick infestation. It must
be recognized that these were still young animals, with presumably
greater resisting power than the mature, but on the other
hand they were of the susceptible northern herds, they were first
infested in the hottest season, and the acquired resistance appears
to have been perfect throughout the succeeding summer. The
added precaution of subjecting them, in late autumn or winter
only, to the ticks raised in a warm room or thermostat, would add
greatly to the safety of the operation. After recovery from the
effects of the first crop of ticks, a second crop of 50 to 100
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>should be placed on the skin so that the system may be thoroughly
habituated to them and the measure of resistance correspondingly
strengthened.</p>

<p class='c008'>This measure may be advantageously applied to valuable cattle
that are to be moved into the infecting territory, but it has
serious drawbacks. The relative strength of the poison introduced
by the ticks to the susceptibility of the animals on which
they are placed, can never be perfectly gauged, and a certain
small but appreciable number of deaths result from this first infesting.
This has been observed in North and South America,
Australia, Roumania and Turkey. Again, the plan entails the
necessity for clean, non infected premises (lots or buildings) for
each fresh lot of cattle, as the places previously used are left in a
tick-infested condition, and are likely to furnish a dangerous excess
of ticks to any susceptible animal. The buildings could, of
course, be disinfected and purified, but this entails considerable
expense.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>c. Infection by Graduated Injections of Blood Containing the
Pyroplasma.</i> Up to the present this is the most promising
method of securing resistance to the pyroplasma. It is advised
to take the blood from an immunized northern animal or from
one indigenous to the infected district. Such an animal is not,
however, strictly speaking <i>immunized</i>. It has acquired a <i>tolerance</i>
so that it is no longer in much danger of succumbing to the
pyroplasma, but it does not exclude the pyroplasma from its system.
The <i>micro-parasite</i> is still found in the blood, though
mainly in the coccus-like form in the interior of the red globules.
The animal to be fortified against the disease is therefore inoculated
with the germ of the disease itself, though it may be, at the
time, in a somewhat inactive form. If, however, the inoculated
animal is specially susceptible, or if the dose is excessive, the disease
is produced in deadly form. The virulence is less in the
case of blood drawn from a northern animal just recovered from
the disease, than from an animal indigenous to the infected district,
and which harbors the pyroplasma, it may be in spore form
(Lignieres), without showing obvious disease. The former
source of the blood is therefore the more desirable, while the
latter is the more easily obtained. The precaution, however,
should be adopted of reducing the dose when taken from an indigenous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>animal. Another important precaution is to select the
winter or cooler season for the operation rather than the summer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The animal which is to furnish the blood may be fixed in stocks,
or held with a bull ring, or it may be cast so that it can be kept
still. The hair is clipped or shaved from over the jugular vein
in the upper third of the neck and the surface is washed with soap
and water and with a five per cent. aqueous solution of carbolic
acid. A thick cord inch (¼ inch) is tied tightly around the back part
of the neck so as to compress and raise the jugulars. With a
sharp pointed bistuory sterilized by boiling, a small incision is
made through the skin, directly over the centre of the jugular
and a cannula and trochar ⅒th inch in diameter and sterilized by
boiling, is passed obliquely upward through the coats of the vein
and the trochar withdrawn. The blood flows through the
cannula and is received in a sterilized (scalded) glass beaker.
The blood is stirred slowly with a sterilized glass rod until all the
fibrine has coagulated when the latter is lifted out and the remaining
liquid blood is ready for use. The blood is injected with a
hypodermic syringe which, with its nozzle, has been thoroughly
sterilized by boiling. The point selected for injection is usually
back of the scapula on the middle of the chest. The skin is
clipped or shaved, washed with soap, soaked in a five per cent.
carbolic acid solution, then pinched up, perforated with the point
of the bistuory, and with the nozzle of the syringe passed through
this wound the blood is injected into the subcutaneous connective
tissue. The slight wound may then be covered with tar or collodion
or merely left undressed. The mass of blood in the connective
tissue may be diffused through its meshes by rubbing so as to
favor absorption.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose of defibrinated blood employed is 5cc. if from an
<i>immunized</i> northern ox, or 3cc. or even 2½ cc. if from an indigenous
animal. The animal operated on should be in good health
and condition, well fed, and kept if possible in the shade, in a
cool stable, or under trees.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some respects it is preferable to operate on the animals before
they are moved from the north or other noninfected territory,
but as there is danger of infection in preserving and carrying the
blood, the treatment is more conveniently deferred until the animal
reaches the infected region where the blood can be had fresh. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>such cases the animals should be shipped in carefully disinfected
cars, and before leaving they should be liberally oiled or larded
so that the ticks will not climb upon them, in being led to their
stable. They must be kept stabled until the febrile effects of the
injection have entirely passed, usually a month or more.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>d. Injection of Blood from Bodies of the Ticks.</i> In view of the
difficulty of shipping infected blood without danger of contamination
or sepsis, and the occasional accidents that happen to animals
injected with such blood outside of the infected area, attempts
have been made with dried blood, or that charged with antiseptics
(calcium oxalate), or that had been frozen, but in every instance
the virulence of the pyroplasma was destroyed. Dalrymple
and Dodson availed of the blood drawn by mature ticks, which,
in their blood-gorged condition, were shipped to the points where
the injections were to be made. The mature ticks charged with
blood were taken from infected indigenous cattle, and at once
shipped. On their arrival they were washed externally with a
mercuric chloride solution (1:1000) to destroy any adherent
saprophytic or other bacteria, mashed in a sterilized mortar, with
a few cubic centimeters of boiled water and the fluid portion
drawn off and injected subcutem, into the animal to be protected.
From 3 to 12 mature female ticks were used for each animal.
The results were the same, only milder than when the blood of
the indigenous animal was used direct, and the subsequent tolerance
of the pyroplasma proved satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is difficult to explain the moderate effect of the considerable
mass of blood injected in such cases, as compared with the deadly
effect of the small amount that could come from the insertion of
the rostra of even 50 or 100 ticks. But perhaps the venomous
saliva instilled in concentrated form into the bites, protects the
pyroplasma in the very limited area, until it gains sufficiently in
numbers and force to hold its own even in the circulating blood.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Limited Value of Artificially Induced Tolerance.</i> It must be
added that all these measures for securing a partial immunity in
the individual animal, and which enable us to safely introduce
previously susceptible cattle into an infected district, virtually
imply the continuance of the infection and infection bearer
(boöphilus) for all time. They give no promise of the extinction
of the bovine infection at even a remote future time, nor the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>abolition of the taxes for prevention, which must oppress the
southern cattle owner so long as the disease continues. They
are most valuable measures truly, but mere temporizing ones at
the best, and they could just as well give place to the more sanitary,
economical and statesmanlike measures for its radical extinction.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Marketing of the Beef.</i> The piroplasma is not communicable to
man, so that the carcasses of well conditioned cattle, which bear
the infection need not be rejected as human food. It is only in
severe and advanced cases in which anæmia, emaciation and pallid
innutritious muscles are marked features, that the flesh is
objectionable, and then only as being somewhat lacking in nutriment
and digestibility,—not because of poisonous qualities.
Danger of infection to cattle might be apprehended, but, if used
outside the infected area, the second condition of the disease—the
boöphilus—is lacking, while within the existing area of prevalence
of the fever, the propagation from the carcass to the animal
is infinitely less likely than from one live animal to its fellow.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Federal Restrictions on Cattle within Infected Areas.</i> The orders
of the Secretary of Agriculture prohibit the removal of cattle from
the following states and territory into any states that extend northward
of the line indicated: California, Oklahoma, Indian Territory,
Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia and the states south of these
to the Gulf of Mexico. Exceptions are made in the case of fat
cattle, sent out of an infected area, for immediate slaughter at the
point of destination; conveyed in cars or boats placarded as containing
Southern cattle and receiving no other; fed and watered
enroute in yards that admit no local or other cattle and which
can be reached without passing over any highway or unfenced open
ground; and unshipped at their destination directly into yards
reserved for Southern cattle only and within the same enclosure
as the slaughter house. If reshipped the cars used must be subjected
to the same restrictions. The cars, boats, chutes, alleyways,
pens and troughs are to be disinfected by thorough cleaning;
by saturation of all wood work, etc., with a mixture of 1½
℔s. lime, ¼ ℔. phenic acid and 1 gallon of water, or ¼ ℔. chloride
of lime in a gallon of water, or a jet of steam under a pressure
of 30 ℔s. to the square inch. The manure and litter must be
mixed with quicklime, or saturated with a 5 per cent. solution of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>carbolic acid, or secluded in a well fenced enclosure from February
1st to November 15th of each year. This is made the duty
of the stock yard companies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cattle may be freely moved north from the infected area at
any time from November 1st to December 31st, if inspected by an
officer of the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture and found free from
infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Provision is also made for sending infected cattle northward at
any season, if they have been first dipped and pronounced free
from the disease by an inspector of the department.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cattle from Mexico are admitted under analogous rules.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>PROTOZOAN ICTERO HÆMATURIA IN SHEEP. PALUDISM OF SHEEP. CARCEAG.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is described by Babes and Starcovici as prevailing among
sheep in the delta of the Danube, and held by them to be identical
with the Roumanian Hæmoglobinuria of cattle (compt. rend.
de l’Acad. des Sciences, 1892). Its essential cause is a piroplasma
affecting the red blood globules, and very analogous
to that of the protozoön of Texas fever, but its especial election
for the sheep shows a specific difference, inasmuch as the Texas
cattle fever does not attack sheep. Not only the parasite, but
the symptoms and lesions as well, furnish a close counterpart to
those of the cattle infection. It remains to be seen whether the
pathogenic difference is due to a distinction in the piroplasma or
to the absence from the Southern States of America of the particular
tick or other insect which attacks the Danubian sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bonome (1895, Virchow’s Archives) describes the same
disease as prevailing in Italy, describing the parasite and lesions
at great length.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally my colleague Dr. W. L. Williams, and later Dr.
Knowles, have identified the disease in the upper part of Deer
Lodge Valley and the lower part of Silver Bow Valley in Montana,
prevailing among sheep only, extending year by year, and
proving disastrous to the sheep husbandry. Sheep were introduced
into these valleys as early as 1875, but it was only in 1891
that the flock masters recognized the existence of this disease.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>By 1895 it prevailed over an area of 300 square miles. It made
its advent in 1891 in four or five large flocks (2,000 to 10,000
head each) on land which they had occupied for nine years, and
so disastrously that several sheep ranchers, after an experience
of a year or two, sold out to the butcher and abandoned the
sheep industry.</p>

<p class='c008'>All or nearly all cases seen in 1896 were in parturient ewes,
(4 to 6 days after parturition), the constitutional condition attending
on lambing proving a most potent factor in causation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The protozoön repeated the characters of that found in the
sick sheep in Italy and the Danubian delta, and the conditions of
the blood and the structural lesions supported the idea of identity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Altitude seems to have little or no effect as a causative factor,
as the disease is domiciled alike on the low alluvium of the
Danube and the Deer Lodge Valley of Montana over 5,000 feet
above the ocean. In both regions there is the common condition
of inundation or its equivalent irrigation, for the Montana range
is dry and arid, interspersed with alkaline bogs inimical to vegetation,
but prolific and fruitful under irrigation. The Montana
disease has been attributed to mineral poisons carried on the
winds from the extensive copper smelters in Butte and Anaconda,
but the smelters had been in existence for eight or ten years before
this disease was observed, and from its appearance the infection
has gradually extended, attacking sheep only, and sparing
other domestic animals, which would have suffered as well
from a mere mineral poison on the vegetation. The doctrine
of a mineral poison is equally contradicted by the habitual prevalence
of the disease in spring and autumn, while it is dormant
in winter and summer. In winter the flocks eat hay cut from
the richer valley lands and meadows, while in summer they are
pastured on the foothills and mountains, and drink from the
mountain springs surrounded by alkaline bogs. The autumn
outbreak occurs long after the mountain grasses have dried up,
when the flocks are thrown back on the supplies obtained from
the alkaline bogs and the valley pastures. In late winter and
early spring the growth naturally starts first in the same boggy
and valley areas, and both facts suggest a microbian infection—protozoan
or bacteridian. If an intermediate host or bearer—insect
or other invertebrate—is to be assumed it implies two generations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>of these, a spring and an autumn one, in the same
season, or otherwise a restriction of such invertebrate to the low
valley pastures and the alkaline bogs on the higher levels, and
that they disappear from the drier, arid areas in summer. It
cannot be an obligate parasite like a louse or melophagus which
would be constantly present, nor a musquito absent in early
spring. But up to the present no invertebrate host or intermediate
bearer has been identified. Cases were at first reported in
the Angora goat, but this animal is now known to be immune.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> The parasite is formed in the red globules and
blood serum of the affected sheep and closely resembles the microbe
of Texas fever. In the blood globules the parasite is seen
in different forms, round, oval, oblong or curved and from one
tenth to one sixth the diameter of the red globule. A single red
globule may show from one to four of the microörganisms. They
may at times show indications of division, and at others, automatic
amœboid movements, from one portion of the blood globule
to another, or from the periphery toward the centre. The affected
blood globules are usually enlarged, having lost their biconcave
outline, and become biconvex or spherical, with irregular crenated
surface, and a dull, lustreless appearance instead of a clear red or
yellow aspect. The protozoön stains readily in anilin red or
methylene blue.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The condition of the carcass was good or even high,
in sheep attacked when in good flesh, and in which the affection
ran a rapid and fatal course. In sheep attacked while in low
condition on the other hand, the case tended to be milder and
more prolonged, and the body was emaciated and anæmic.
Dropsical swellings were common on the ears and sides of the
head and neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>The skin, connective tissue, fat, and other normally white
tissues were usually of a yellow color, varying from sulphur to
lemon color. The muscles were pale and soft with a yellowish
tinge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blood was pale, thin and watery, especially in protracted
cases, formed a loose coagulum, or remained fluid with a grayish
red color. There was marked leucocytosis (1:4 or 5).</p>

<p class='c008'>The stomach and intestines were more or less icteric, and contained
little ingesta.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>The liver was congested, softened, shrunken in protracted
cases, colored of a deep yellow especially in the interior, and
with gorged biliary radicles so that the acini stood out very
prominently. The gall bladder was usually well filled with a
thick, flocculent bile, yellowish green, blackish green or chocolate
color.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spleen appeared shrunken, somewhat spherical, 2 to 3 ozs.,
firm, and with a dark, reddish brown pulp.</p>

<p class='c008'>The kidneys were greatly enlarged, weighing 12 to 16 ozs.,
dark red or bluish black, friable, and on section exuding freely a
bloody or chocolate-colored liquid. The capsule was easily detached.
The bladder contained a bloody or chocolate-colored
urine, but was sometimes empty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The heart cavities were empty or contained small diffluent
blood clots. Petechiæ were common on pericardium and endocardium.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yellowish or yellowish green gelatinoid effusion was often
present, not only on the head and neck, but also on the inner
side of the thighs, and in one or other of the serous cavities.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The first indications noticed are dulness, listlessness,
a dragging behind the flock, ceasing to graze, arched
back, and stiff or unsteady movements. There is moderate fever,
yellowness of the visible mucosæ and skin, and rosy, bloody,
or reddish brown urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Puffy dropsical swellings are noticed, especially on the ears,
sides of the face, on the neck or thighs, and the patient lies down
most of the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient usually dies in a state of collapse which has lasted
for several hours, yet in certain cases it is preceded by a convulsive
agony.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is certain that the affection may appear in a mild form, as
sheep slaughtered in apparent health are found to show the general
icterus, the congested liver, and the leucocytosis with crenation
of the red globules which characterize the disease. The
icteric carcasses are said to be recognized and condemned at
Kansas City and Omaha.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>duration</i> of the affection is from 1 to 5 days, though it
may last longer, and severe attacks usually end in death.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>prevention</i> of this disease can, as yet, be based only on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>same principles that guide us in the case of Texas fever. Search
should be made for an invertebrate host of the protozoön, by the
extinction of which infection may be stopped. The spring outbreak
could be opposed by feeding hay on safe ground until the
higher pastures furnish sufficient vegetation. To counteract the
autumn attack, the sheep might be fenced out from the alkaline
bogs, and the forage supplied in the form of hay or soiling crops.
If it should appear that any wild animals harbor or transmit the
parasite, a campaign of extermination upon them would be in
order. If, as seems to have been the case in the early nineties,
the movement of sheep from the infected flocks and pastures
tends to cause the disease, this should be legally interdicted.
Finally, the complete extermination of the sheep on infected
areas could be practiced, and their place supplied by the immune
Angora goat.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PALUDISM IN DOGS. MALIGNANT PROTOZOAN JAUNDICE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Distribution: Senegal, Lyons, E. Africa, Paris, Pas de Calais, Cape
Colony. Microbiology: piroplasma: differentiation from that of Texas
fever: pathogenesis: tick-borne. Symptoms: incubation 3 to 5 days;
dulness, prostration, apathy, drowsiness, anorexia, thirst, hyperthermia,
icterus, hæmoglobinuria, offensive odor, emaciation, protozoön in globules,
loss of globules. Death in collapse. Lesions: body shrunken, emaciated,
fœtid; dark tissues, mahogany yellow, petechiæ, enlarged congested liver
and spleen; muco-enteritis; bloody urine. Treatment unsatisfactory.
Prevention: keep from tick infested land; clear and cultivate land; smear
dog with insecticide ointment when hunting.</p>

<p class='c007'>In certain malarial districts dogs suffer severely and even
fatally from a febrile affection in which violent shivering is followed
by great hyperthermia and yellowish or brownish red discoloration
of the visible mucosæ. It was frequently attributed
to malaria, and even sought to be identified with intermittent
fever in man. Marchoux in 1899 studied this disease on the
malarious seaboard of Senegal, and recognized the existence of
hæmoglobinuria and the presence in the red globules of a hæmatozoön.
Leblanc, about the same date, found a protozoön in the
blood of dogs at Lyons, suffering from “red water,” and Koch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>later found a double piroplasma in the red globules of suffering
dogs in East Africa, both considering the disease analogous to
Texas fever in cattle. Nocard and Almy in 1901, at Charenton,
Paris, met with a similar affection in a dog which had just returned
from a fox hunt, and was covered with ticks. Its urine
was brownish red, like coffee-grounds, and highly charged with
albumen and hæmoglobin. Many of the red globules were
affected and contained minute, spherical refrangent bodies which,
when stained with carbolized thionine, appeared like those of
Texas fever. There were but 2,800,000 red globules in a cubic
millimetre of blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The injection of 5 grammes of the blood into the jugular of
an aged bitch caused in the 3d day hyperthermia (105° F.) and
an extensive invasion of the red globules which still counted
6,100,000 per  mm. On the 4th day the animal was thoroughly
prostrated, refused to eat, had hæmoglobinuria, and many individual
red globules enclosed from 4 to 8 hæmatozoa each. On
the 5th day the count of the red globules was but 4,400,000 per
mm. By the 6th day the urine was nearly normal, and appetite
returned, but the red globules counted but 3,500,000 per  mm.
Menveux went to Pas de Calais with an Irish setter to hunt
rabbits. The dog came in every night covered with ticks. In
5 days he sickened, with extreme prostration, diarrhœa and red
urine and died on the 25th day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wm. Robertson describes the disease in Cape Colony. The
piroplasma was first identified at Grahamstown by Purves and successfully
inoculated by Spreul. By intravenous inoculation
symptoms appeared on the fourth day and death followed about
the sixth, while by subcutaneous inoculation the course was
slower and the animal died about the eleventh day. Robertson
inoculating from animal to animal carried it through a succession
of thirteen dogs all of which perished. He found the
blood to be infecting on the third day after inoculation subcutem,
and the globules invaded on the fourth. They were especially
numerous in blood taken from the spleen.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> The protozoön resembles that of Texas fever,
but is larger, longer, less pyriform, and more like an oat seed,
staining slightly in the centre which shows one clear spot, and more
deeply at two or three places in the margin. It stains well with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>carbol thionine blue or methylene blue, but not readily with
hæmatoxylin. The dog’s blood, containing abundance of parasites,
failed to infect horse, sheep, ox, cat, fowl, Guinea pig,
rabbit, rat or mouse (Robertson).</p>

<p class='c008'>Robertson found the ticks on every affected dog which had
contracted the disease by simple exposure and which came under
his observation. Specimens sent to Neumann were identified as
Hæmaphysalis Leachi. Mature ticks from an infected dog were
preserved and their eggs hatched in an incubator. The resultant
six-legged larvæ, placed on susceptible puppies a month old
proved harmless and no protozoa appeared in their blood. This
was repeated when the same generation of ticks had reached the
stage of nympha, and it was after two months from the hatching
that the ticks, now mature, when placed on the same puppies
conveyed the disease. On the thirteenth day the temperature
reached 105° F., and the red globules swarmed with parasites,
many single globules containing no fewer than eight. They were
of various shapes, spherical, pyriform or cloveshaped many
tapering finely toward the ends like an oat. The puppies died
respectively 14 and 18 days after infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Experiments made on other dogs with the larval and mature
ticks, fully confirmed the conclusion that the immature insect
was harmless. A 14 days old puppy infected by mature ticks
died on the 11th day so that the immunity of the other puppies
cannot be due to a milk diet, as in the case of calves and Texas
fever. Intravenous inoculation with the infected blood invariably
conveyed the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> On the third day after inoculation the dog is dull,
prostrate, apathetic and drowsy, refuses food and shows thirst.
Temperature may reach 103° to 106° F. On the fourth day
the mucosæ assume a yellowish tinge, and by the fifth this has
encreased to a deep chrome yellow, which involves any white
portions of the skin as well. Hæmoglobinuria is now well developed,
the liquid being often as dark as claret, and the patient
may lie perfectly prostrate, giving off an offensive odor from the
skin, lungs, and especially from the mouth. The tongue is
furred, the teeth dirty, and the gums may be congested or even
ulcerated. Emaciation advances rapidly. The temperature may
oscillate from day to day or it may rise steadily to a climax, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>then descend suddenly when collapse occurs. In all cases the protozoön
is found in the red globules, or free in the blood. In the
worst cases the red globules may be so reduced in number that
they can scarcely be found. Death comes usually by collapse.
In some instances the hæmoglobinuria may be absent yet the
disease advances to a fatal result.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The carcass is usually shrunken and emaciated and
exhales a fœtid odor. The mucosæ, white skin, and all naturally
white structures (fat, connective tissue, fascia, tendons, ligaments,
brain, spinal cord, etc.), are stained of a deep yellow.
The muscles, liver and other darker tissues are of a mahogany
yellow; petechiæ appear on the heart and serosæ; the liver is
greatly enlarged and friable (10 lbs.) the spleen is swollen, gorged
with blood and a soft, black, bloody pulp; the stomach and small
intestines are empty, yellow and sometimes congested. The large
intestines show muco-enteritis throughout with an abundant rusty
red exudate. The kidneys are yellowish with cortex somewhat
pale. The bladder also yellow contains dark colored urine.
The red blood globules are greatly diminished in number, many
are crenated, broken up and distorted and they contain the piroplasma
in large numbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>No system of <i>treatment</i> has proved successful. Essays would
naturally be made with quinia and other antiperiodics.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention</i> would naturally be sought in keeping dogs off from
the uncultivated land and brush during the tick season (summer,
autumn), in clearing and cultivating the tick infested pastures,
in drainage, or in smearing the coat of the dog with the oil of tar
liniment or other insecticide when he goes hunting.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PALUDISM IN HORSES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Alleged identity with ague. Geographical distribution. Points of difference
from ague. Causes: low, damp, undrained, inundated localities, hot seasons;
inoculation, congenital. Symptoms: restless, drowsy, stiff, shivering,
hyperthermia, tremors, cough, frothy, rusty expectoration, excited breathing
and pulse, anorexia; puffy, petechiated eyelids; epiphora; dyspnœa: albuminous,
yellow or red urine with casts: hæmoglobinæmia: colics, constipation,
fœtid diarrhœa. Death in a few hours to 6 days, or months.
Lesions: reduction in blood globules, crenation, watery blood: petechiæ:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>enlarged, blood-gorged liver and spleen; congested, swollen, softened, kidneys;
congested lungs with extravasations: in chronic—anæmia, dropsies,
lung hepatization and suppuration. Prevention: keep susceptible horses
from low, infected lands from June to November and from their water: protect
from insect enemies. Treatment: quinia sulphate or bromide, hot
baths, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cadeac and others describe an intermittent or remittent febrile
affection of the horse, as identical with ague, and due, they
allege, to the presence in the blood of the <i>plasmodium malariæ</i> of
Laveran.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> It has been observed on the low
marshy grounds of Sicily, the Danube bottom lands, Algiers,
Tonkin, Madagascar, Soudan, Senegal and Cochin China (Dupuy,
Lenoir, Pierre, Colin). Dr. Gelston informs me that in the
American cavalry in the Philippines extensive losses are sustained
from this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Microbiology.</i> The causation of the disease is attributed to the
<i>plasmodium malariæ</i>, which is carried by the Anopheles and inoculated
in the skin of man, in malarious regions at night, but we
are confronted with the difficulty, that accepting the alleged identity,
the disease in the horse should be coextensive with that occurring
in man. Yet we have in the New World many areas
characterized by the all but universal prevalence of intermittent
fever in man, and at the same time by its entire absence in the
case of the equine races. It may further be considered that protozoa,
found in the red globules of birds, were at one time considered
identical with those of malarious fever, but have been demonstrated
to be entirely different so far as pathogenesis is concerned.
There is every presumption that the protozoa of the red globules
found in the horse in this disease are also distinct pathogenically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Laveran has sought in vain for his plasmodium in the blood of
the affected horses, while Pierre found in the blood globules of
the Soudan victims refrangent, crescent shaped bodies, thickened
and staining deeply in the centre, which in his opinion represented
the growing hæmatozoa of Laveran. Gelston found the rounded
and crescent shaped forms abundant in the red globules. The
disease in the horse is said to be conveyed by direct contact, which
would again distinguish it from intermittent fever of man. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>the protozoön is the cause, and not a mere sequel or attendant on
the disease of the horse, the indications are that it is peculiar to
the equine race and distinct from the germ of human malaria.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> Like malarial diseases in man, it is confined to low,
damp, undrained or inundated localities, and shows in the hot
seasons when the surface dries out. The elevated plains and
tablelands which are habitually dry or well drained are exempt.
Cadeac alleges that infection is usually inhaled in the floating
dust. The mortality of Algerian horses taken to the Soudan is
90 per cent., while but 25 to 35 per cent. of the native horses in
the Soudan or in Senegal suffer. This difference is manifestly
the result of the survival of a comparatively immune strain of
blood, or of immunity resulting from a previous invasion. Subcutaneous
inoculation on a soliped failed, while transfusion of blood
from the affected horse to a sound mule produced the disease. It
is also claimed that it is transmitted from the affected mare to the
fœtus in utero, which showed characteristic visceral lesions after
birth.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> Premonitory symptoms of restlessness, drowsiness,
or stiffness, are followed by violent shivering, elevation of temperature
(104° or 106° F.), muscular tremors, rapid breathing,
hacking cough with expectoration of frothy mucus, tumultuous
heart beats, and small irritable pulse. There is complete anorexia,
an opaque, infiltrated, petechiated, mahogany colored, conjunctiva,
epiphora, and sometimes blood extravasations into the vitreous.
The lungs may become intensely congested, with rapid,
panting breathing, dyspnœa, a frothy, rusty expectoration, and
extended head and limbs. This may prove fatal in a few hours.
Otherwise there may be remissions of the fever and dyspnœa at
somewhat irregular intervals. Sooner or later are observed urinary
changes, the liquid becomes albuminous, yellow, or red, or
it shows distinct casts. These indicate the destruction of the red
globules and the escape of hæmoglobin. In other cases there
are slight colics and constipation alternating with a greenish yellow
fœtid diarrhœa. The early nervous prostration and drowsiness
may merge into vertigo, or paralysis. Vertigo is a very
prominent feature in the Philippine cases (Gelston). The skin
which, at first, may often be pricked without response, sometimes
becomes tender, itchy and congested, with erection of the hairs
and the formation of pustules, or small abscesses like hazelnuts.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span><i>Course. Duration.</i> In very acute cases death may take place
in a few hours. More commonly illness lasts from three to six days.
In certain instances it becomes chronic and may last two or even
three months, the early congestion of the mucosæ giving place to
pallor and anæmia with advancing emaciation, dropsies and finally
marasmus and death.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> These are mainly in the blood, red globules being
distorted, crenated, massed in clusters and greatly diminished in
numbers so that the liquid appears thin and watery. The mucosæ,
internal organs and serosæ are petechiated and the serous
cavities contain a yellowish serum. A yellowish tint pervades
the white tissues generally. The liver is congested, virtually
gorged with blood, enlarged and yellow or yellowish brown. The
spleen is greatly enlarged, blood gorged, and shows irregular,
rounded swellings indicating the seats of extravasation of blood.
In some instances rupture has taken place. The kidneys are congested,
enlarged, softened and of a brownish red or black color,
with circumscribed extravasations especially in the cortical area.
The lungs are violently congested, with many areas of blood
extravasation, and they do not collapse when the chest is opened.
The heart is petechiated, with a parboiled aspect and shows areas
of commencing necrosis or fatty degeneration.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the chronic form the watery condition of the blood is remarkable,
the serous cavities (peritoneum, pleuræ, pericardium, arachnoid)
contain considerable effusion, dropsical conditions of the
limbs and dependent parts of the body are common, the lungs
show hepatization and minute centres of suppuration, and other
viscera may show fibroid degeneration.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> It is advisable to keep susceptible horses from the
low marshy infected lands from June to November and to avoid
especially water that is drawn from such lands. It is not needful
to take the stock to any very marked elevation provided the land
is dry and free from wet or swampy areas. The native horses or
those that have been long in the marshy district and have thus
secured a partial immunity may profitably replace the more
recently imported and susceptible horses during the dangerous
summer months.</p>

<p class='c008'>The habit of the paludal protozoa of securing their transfer
from one of the higher animals to another through the intermediation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>of insects in which they undergo developmental changes
essential to their survival, would further suggest the adoption of
especial precautions against such invertebrate enemies in the
affected district.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> Pierre employed quinia sulphate or bromide 45 grs.
in distilled water 1 oz., intravenously, Gelston, creolin, subcutem.
Hot baths, 95° to 100° F. are claimed to lower the temperature
and contribute to the arrest of an attack. Other complications are
treated according to indications.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An acute, relapsing, protozoan fever of equines,
camels and elephants, inoculable on other animals, occurring
during or after the rainy season, and characterized by hyperthermia
which is liable to be intermittent, remittent or relapsing,

eruption, nasal, ophthalmic, vaginal and other mucous discharges,
rapidly advancing anæmia, emaciation and debility, and
above all, by the presence in the blood, at intervals from one to
six days, of swarms of protozoa, analogous to those found in
dourine or nagana.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Geographical Distribution.</i> Surra has long been known to the
English veterinarians in India, occurring during or just after the
rainy season, and especially on the low flooded lands, along
canals, rivers, lakes, etc., and later in Burma, Cochin China, the
Persian Gulf, Persia. Lingard claims its existence in East
Africa, North and South America, Australia and Southern
Europe, but he has evidently confounded it with nagana and
other affections. The discovery of the disease by Dr. Slee in
1901, among American, Australian and Chinese ponies in the
Philippines is suggestive of a very wide diffusion of the infection
in Southern Asia and adjacent islands, with which an American
work on veterinary medicine must deal.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cause. Parasite. Trypanosoma Evansi.</i> The essential cause
of the disease, Trypanosoma Evansi, discovered by Dr. Griffith
Evans, Inspecting Veterinary Surgeon, British Army, in 1880,
is a flagellate infusorian, pointed at one end, near which is a
dark centrosome, and from this a flagellum running along the
free border of the broad undulating membrane to the extreme opposite
end of the parasite and extended beyond this as a waving
lash. The length of the Trypanosoma Evansi is 20 to 50μ, (10
to 14μ, Smith and Kinyoun, Manila), its breadth 1 to 1.5μ. By
reason of its large size and active motion it is easily detected in
a film of fresh blood under ⅙th inch objective, and no less easily
when dried and stained on a cover glass. It must be borne in
mind that the mature parasite appears in the blood at intervals
in swarms, so that examination at one time of day, or on a particular
day, may fail to detect it, while examinations made earlier
or later are successful. The general structure and successive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>stages of growth of the parasite appear to be the same as described
for the Trypanosoma Equiperdum of Dourine, to which
accordingly the reader may turn for description. The distinction
from that parasite is to be found mainly in the pathogenesis. In
this respect it should be noted that the parasites are strongly attracted
by the red globules, upon which they fasten themselves by
the blunt ends, shaking the cell in the most vigorous manner and
even breaking pieces off and carrying them away. They are most
strongly attracted by the concave part of the disc, and when
there are rouleaux they will bore between the globules and even
push them apart (Evans).</p>

<p class='c008'>The appearance of the disease at the conclusion of the rainy
season when the waters dry up and become foul, has led to the
idea that the parasite lives in waters, but as this is also the time
of the great swarming and activity of flies, and as the trypanosoma
is found in the bodies of tabanidæ and hippoboscidæ that
have bitten affected animals (Lingard), and as horses crowded
together so that the fly with piercing apparatus still wet can pass
from horse to horse (Evans), the opinion has grown that it is a
compulsory parasite which is transmitted through the bites of insects.
In 1880, Griffith Evans found that the native Hindoos attributed
the disease to the bites of a very large brown fly which
was active in July (probably a tabanus), in 1897, Pease identified
the incriminated fly as the tabanus tropicus. Finally, Rodgers,
in 1901, took flies that had been on surra horses, kept them 4
days or longer and found that their bites failed to produce surra;
whereas those that were allowed to go directly from the sick to
the healthy animal produced the disease in the latter. The direct
experimental inoculation from horse to horse infallibly conveys
the disease so that the flies are not needed to pass the parasite
through an intermediate stage of its existence, but merely to
carry it. It follows that no particular fly is the bearer but any
insect may carry the infection from a bite or sore to inoculate it
on a sore or by a bite on a fresh animal. Different observers
have noticed the tendency to the infection of dogs and other animals
that fed from rubbish heaps, or upon the carcasses of animals
dead of surra, suggesting at once the intervention of the
swarms of flies that congregate at such places. This is probably
another example of the shrewd insight of the common mind, as
in the case of the tick-borne Texas fever.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>Lingard finds another bearer in the crow which sits on the
backs of affected horses, pecking at the wounds, and passes at
once to other healthy horses to peck their sores.</p>

<p class='c008'>Experiments in feeding the infested blood to sound animals,
have apparently succeeded, and the observation that dogs and
cats suffer from eating the carcasses is in favor of this view.
Horses that lick the infested sores, or the blood drawn by the
flies may readily infect themselves, and especially if the mouth
bears scratches caused by fibrous food, leech bites, or sores from
bits, or if the pharynx or stomach has been wounded by bots or
spiroptera.</p>

<p class='c008'>The water and food are blamed by the natives in some quarters,
but Pease’s observations on the Bombay tramway horses,
which all perished though kept on boiled water and carefully
picked fodder from sound regions, would suggest that this if a
channel of infection at all, is not the main one.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bowel excretions of rats harboring trypanosoma, when
mixed experimentally with the food of the horse, have been
charged with causing surra, but there are objections to the acceptance
of this as a common cause. The alleged period of incubation
in the horse in such cases was 40 days in place of the
usual 7 or 8 days, when inoculated from a horse first affected in this
experiment on a second the usual incubation of 7 or 8 days was
shown, and though the horse fed on rat’s dung in the infected region
of Bombay contracted the disease, the experiment failed when the
same dung was fed in a high dry region unaffected by surra.
The natural inference is that Bombay experimental horses contracted
the affection in the usual way, probably through insects.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the rainy season the Indian rats swarm with the Trypanosoma
Lewisi, an entirely different species, and though they can be successfully
inoculated with the T. Evansi of Surra, the T. Equiperdum
of Dourine, the T. Brucii of Nagana, and it is alleged the
T. Equinum of Mal de Caderas, yet these are not their common
parasite. The presumption is that the rat affected with Trypanosoma
Evansi could transmit the disease to the horse through one
of the many possible insect channels or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither condition, sex nor age appears to affect receptivity.
Open sores especially open the way for infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The position of stables, yards, pastures or picket grounds near
stagnant water, manure or rubbish heaps, abattoirs or other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>places that breed or attract flies, is a much more important consideration.
Foul stables, or those having light from both sides
are more exposed to flies.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathology and Lesions.</i> The pathology of the disease consists
in the rapid destruction of the red blood globules by the trypanosomata.
It is a form of rapidly advancing pernicious anæmia
due to the great and active voracity of the trypanosoma. The
swarming of the trypanosoma in the blood at the period of the
relapse and the absence of the mature form in the intervals is remarkable.
The trembling movement in the blood at the period
of swarming results from their prodigiously active movements.
The red globules may assume various forms, crenate, echinated,
(Ranking), and more or less broken up or disintegrated, their
numbers steadily decrease, leaving the blood thin and watery
with rusty serum and yellow (icteric) staining of the white
tissues, even the bones. Encrease of white globules, actual or
relative, has been a marked feature (always present in typical
cases, Burke).</p>

<p class='c008'>Petechiæ are especially common on the conjunctiva, vaginal
mucosa, endocardium, and less marked in the nose, mouth, and
serosæ.</p>

<p class='c008'>Œdemas are common, yellowish, gelatinoid exudate at the base
of the heart, subcutem, between the muscles of the limbs or elsewhere,
and as effusions into the pleuræ, pericardium or peritoneum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Distinct blood extravasations have been noted beneath the endocardium.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spleen is often enlarged, excessively so if death occurred
during a paroxysm. The lymph glands are swollen and appear
dropsical.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole body is emaciated and shrunken, the visible (unpetechiated)
mucosæ are pale and bloodless, often yellow, yet
rigor mortis is well marked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gastric ulcers are common (Steel, Burke, G. W. Evans) apparently
preceded in many cases by capillary embolism, congestion
and degeneration. Intestinal congestions are frequent
(Steel, Burke), but ulcers are rare (Geo. H. Evans).</p>

<p class='c008'>The liver may be normal (Griffith Evans), or especially during
a paroxysm (Lingard) congested, inflamed and enlarged. The
pancreas is usually normal.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>The kidneys are petechiated, congested, œdematous, or the
seat of blood extravasations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instances have been noted of cerebral and meningeal œdema
(Steel, Lingard), encrease of fluid in the arachnoid or lateral
ventricles, or in the spinal cord, with gelatinoid exudation in the
lumbar portion (Lingard). Like other tissues, in advanced
stages the nerve centres are usually anæmic (Geo. H. Evans).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> As made out by inoculation cases this extends
from two to eight days, according to the dose—five to seven days
being the most common. Infection by inoculation subcutem in
mules showed a hyperthermia on the fifth day; or by ingestion
(feeding the virus) on the sixth day (Steel). Longer (alleged)
incubation depends mainly on the first slight paroxysms having
been overlooked, or set down for the frequent bilious and icteric
condition which is common in mules and horses in India (Steel),
or to a later infection by insects or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> In experimental cases a small raised swelling in
the seat of the inoculation, appears in 24 hours, encreasing to 2
to 4 inches in diameter, and 1 to 1½ inch high by the 4th day,
and loosely connected with the parts beneath. From the 4th to
the 14th day it decreases in size and softens and general symptoms
set in.</p>

<p class='c008'>In casual cases these general symptoms are the first to be
observed. There is a transient fever 102° to 104°, highest toward
night and without preliminary chill, hot mouth and skin, dulness,
sluggishness, inappetence, yellowness of the mucosæ, petechiæ
on conjunctiva or vulva, and sometimes nodules like those of
urticaria on the skin. After a day or two these symptoms
subside, the temperature is 101° F., or below, the mucosæ
clear and pale, and spirit and appetite nearly normal. These
slight first paroxysms are rarely seen by the veterinarian, having
been looked upon as one of the oft-recurring bilious attacks of a
hot climate. The remission lasts for 3 to 10 days when the
second paroxysm sets in, like the first but often more marked:
temperature 102° to 104°, eyes especially the membrana nictitans
petechiated, epiphora, slight catarrh from nose or vulva, it may
be stocking of the legs, or pitting swelling under the breast bone,
or abdomen, or in the sheath. Like the first, the second paroxysm
subsides, and after another interval a third sets in, to be followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>in like manner by a fourth, a fifth and so on, if the patient survives.
With each the symptoms become more pronounced, the
mucosæ are left more pale and bloodless, debility and weakness
are greater, emaciation is more marked, œdema of the limbs or
body more extensive, hyperthermia may reach 105° or more, the
pulse is weaker and the heart more liable to palpitation, and the
respirations may reach 50 or 60 per minute. Yet in sparely built
animals dropsy may be entirely absent (Steel). Steel often found
superficial, circumscribed ulcers on the tongue, inner sides of the
lips, nose, eye, or vulva, beginning as epithelial degeneration,
followed by superficial erosion and early healing. Sometimes,
similar erosions appeared on the skin. Generative excitement
may be present, the mare appears to be in heat, while the horse
has erections, which are supposed to depend directly on the implication
of the generative centre in the lumbar myelon. The
submaxillary glands sometimes swell and even suppurate and discharge
a gluey pus (Griffith Evans). The bowels are usually
costive at first, the fæces may be glazed, but in advanced stages
they become soft, pultaceous and fœtid. The urine at first
normal in amount, becomes later abundant or even profuse
(Griffith Evans, Ranking, Nariman and Vaz, Lingard). It is
at first yellow and turbid, later of a dingy green or greenish yellow.
Sometimes it diminishes as the disease advances. It may
contain bile, albumen, or even casts (G. H. Evans), though
the latter appear to be exceptional. The reaction varies, sugar
is absent, and the parasite has not been found in it. Appetite
though interfered with during the paroxysms, remains fair or
even voracious in the intervals and the animals may eat to the
last (Burke). Thirst usually encreases with the advance of the
disease, in keeping with the free urinary secretion. Rumbling
and gurgling of the bowels are common and even tympany at
times (Lingard).</p>

<p class='c008'>In the advanced stages the picture is one of great anæmia,
marasmus and general debility. When moved the animal will
stumble over the slightest obstacle, even the litter, recovering
himself with effort and difficulty. If he should fall he is liable to
remain down indefinitely, the side next the ground becoming
drenched with sweat though there is no general perspiration.
The hair becomes encreasingly dry, withered and erect, the skin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>dry, powdery, rigid and more and more firmly adherent to the
bones and muscles, losing all its natural pliancy and mellowness,
and becoming like that of a dead animal. It is bloodless, and
sloughs readily over the prominent bones, where compressed or
bruised in lying, owing to the lack of nutritive and reparatory
action. The visible mucosæ are absolutely bloodless. The muscles
as a whole are wasted to an extreme degree, but this atrophy
is most marked in the back and loins, along the longissimus dorsi
and in the quarter in the gluteal muscles. The patient may
remain recumbent, from sheer weakness, for a length of time at
the last, or he may get up after a long recumbency and stand to
the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>Death may occur early with general anasarca and extreme hyperthermia
(110° F.). In the great majority it appears to result
largely from perforation of the stomach, clots in the heart, or
general debility and heart failure.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> With symptoms such as are above described the
discovery of the trypanosoma in the blood completes the diagnosis.
Trypanosoma is found in dourine, nagana and other affections so
that the discovery of it alone would not be conclusive as to the
existence of surra. Nor can the discovery of the parasite always
be made at the first or second attempt. The swarm of mature
trypanosomata is found with the advent of a paroxysm, and as the
veterinarian is often called during the decline of the attack the
parasites have already retired and elude his investigation. It
becomes needful to take the temperature and examine the blood
daily sometimes for eight or ten days, and when with a sudden
rise of temperature he finds also a swarming of the mature trypanosomata,
the diagnosis is perfect. A drop of blood placed on a
cover glass, pressed down upon the slide, and placed under the
microscope, will show the parasite with eel-like movements
among the blood globules. There may be very few during the
first or second paroxysm, but they become numerous and very
obvious as the disease gains its height. Evans recommends to use
defibrinated blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>They may be dried rapidly on a cover glass, fixed in absolute
alcohol one or two minutes, then stained ten minutes in a mixture
of the two following liquids united just before using:</p>

A remarkable feature of the disease is the formation of immense
abscesses containing a thick, cream-colored pus on the sides of
the chest in the vicinity of the pad, and in the sheath and scrotum
or udder near to the stifle pad. The mortality is nearly as great
as in the horse or mule, yet the camel drivers say that a small
percentage recover.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SURRA IN BOVINES.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The domestic ox, the sacred cow of India (Lingard) and the
water buffalo (caribao) of the Philippines contract Surra. It is
interesting to notice that in these animals the disease is relatively
mild and recoveries are frequent.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Indian buffalo it causes dulness; advancing emaciation;
slight temperature variations; muco-purulent inflammations of
the conjunctiva, cornea, and pituita; and occasionally eruptions
under the breast or belly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among <i>lesions</i> were atrophy, softening of lymph glands, enlarged
liver and spleen (slight), petechiæ and blood extravasations
on the pericardium, epicardium and other serosæ, and on
the intestinal mucosa which sheds its epithelium in patches.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>Stall enzoötics in cattle do not seem to affect horses casually.
The disease is easily conveyed to rabbits, house rats and mice,
dogs, cats and apes. Goats and ducks appeared to be immune
(Penning).</p>

<h3 class='c009'>TREATMENT OF SURRA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In well established cases in the horse, ass or mule no treatment
has succeeded in saving the patient. Almost every germicide
has been called into requisition but without good effect. Among
these may be named: mercuric chloride subcutem, iodine and
potassium iodide intratracheally, iodoform subcutem and intravenously,
oleum terebinthinæ subcutem and intravenously, potassæ
bichromas by veins and stomach, cinchona alkaloids and
arsenic, phenic acid and iodine, quinine, hydrargyri biniodidum,
santonin, potash. The claims of different agents, notably arsenic
and phenic acid, have been supported by the manifest improvement
of condition under their use and the disappearance of the
trypanosoma, but both these conditions may often appear during
intermissions, without medication. The usual outcome is that
the animal dies and the only claim that can be made is a slight
extension of life. This is favored by dry, clean, airy stables,
change of water, rich grain and succulent food (oats, rice, linseed,
barley, gram sorghum, bran, middlings, salt, etc.), with
iron, arsenic, and other tonics, yet the best that can be said for
them is that they have deferred somewhat the inevitable death.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention of Surra.</i> The first consideration is to avoid placing
equines and especially horses and mules, or camels in the infecting
localities in the rainy season and just after it. Oxen and
buffaloes can be used in such places with greater impunity. If
they must be used in such localities, place the stables or pickets
in dry locations well apart from marshes, and stagnant water.
Keep the stables dark during the surra season, open to light on
one side only and with screens in the windows. Make a deep pit
for the manure, keep it well darkened and screened and turn every
particle of manure into this several times a day so that the stable
shall be perfectly clean. All rubbish heaps should be similarly
dealt with. The flies breed in the manure and decaying organic
matter. After each sweeping of the stable sprinkle the manure
in the pit with some disinfectant, phenic acid, tar water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>copperas, etc. Smear the skins of the animals with tar water,
coal tar water, naphthalin, daily if necessary to prevent the attacks
of the flies. Other suggestions in this line can be found
under <i>parasites</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>An important consideration would be to seclude every animal
attacked with surra. The flies can only carry and inoculate the
poison when there is some source from which they can obtain it.
Until we shall learn how many animals, tame and wild, casually
contract the Trypanosoma Evansi we cannot speak of how
effective this may be made, but it is at least a substantial advance
in the line of restriction, since the infected horse or mule in the
vicinity of healthy ones is a constant peril, and as given insects
attack by preference, given favorite genera, the horse flies, coming
from the diseased animal are much more likely than other flies to
attack the sound horses. In a surra season it would be a wise
economy to destroy the infected equine at once, as according to
all past experience, sentence of death has already been passed
upon him, and his preservation even for a hour is hopeless for
him, but full of the gravest danger for others. The carcass and
all pertaining to it, blood especially, should be promptly and
deeply buried and the place thoroughly disinfected.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same way smudges made by burning green grass or
other vegetation, tar, leather or other material producing empyreumatic
products offensive to the fly may be employed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sanitary Police.</i> The Department of Agriculture forbids the
landing in the United States or its dependencies of any animal
from the Phillipines. If the infection should by any accident be
imported no cost should be considered too high to secure a prompt
and thorough extinction of it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>NAGANA. TSETSE FLY DISEASE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Trypanosoma Brucii: attacks horse, ass, mule, cattle, buffalo, antelope,
camel, hyena, dogs, etc. Elephants and zebra, pigeon and hen immune.
Tsétsé fly. Inoculation only certain channel; virulence in dead body 24
hours; in vitro 3 to 4 days, or when dried or heated (122° F.) Symptoms:
hyperthermia; anæmia; leucocytosis; buffy coat; œdemas; catarrhs; wasting;
debility. Lesions: as in surra; trypanosoma in blood at intervals,
bone marrow, lymph glands, spleen. Immunizing unsuccessful. Prevention
as in surra.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>This is an infective disease caused by the <i>Trypanosoma Brucii</i>,
which has been supposed to be identical with <i>Trypanosoma Evansi</i>
but differs in its morphology and in its infectiveness toward a
greater variety of animals. It is 25 to 30μ long by 1.5 to 2.5μ
broad, less pointed at its posterior (nonflagellate) end, broader
undulating membrane, more deeply staining protoplasm, and
more sluggish movements. It invades the blood of horses, asses,
mules, cattle, buffaloes, antelopes, camels, hyenas, and dogs, and
can be inoculated on cats, rats, mice, rabbits, hedgehog, boshbok,
zebra hybrids, Guinea pigs, goats, sheep, weasel, and
monkey (Macacus rhesus). Elephants are immune though they
suffer from T. Evansi, and the zebra is immune though a soliped.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>tsetse fly</i> (glossina morsitans) is credited with being the
main agent in transmitting the parasite to mammals, (see <i>Diptera</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Kauthack, Durham and Blandford found that Guinea pigs
were more resistant than rabbits, surviving the inoculation for a
longer time. Bruce also found the native South African sheep
and goats more refractory than others, yet their hæmatozoön was
as deadly to other animals as that of horse or dog. Pigeons and
South African hens proved refractory. Manifestly in Africa the
present races of some animals are the products of the survival of
the fittest.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Inoculation.</i> The disease has been produced experimentally
by inoculation only. Feeding experiments on rabbits, cats and
Guinea pigs, the sucking by puppies of an infected dam for 14
days, coitus, and even the careful dropping of infected blood
under the eyelid failed to convey it. Lousy rats with sores on
face, one cat doubtless scratched by a bone, and one rabbit supposed
to be infected by sexual congress (Rouget) offer exceptions,
which in the light of the general results must be looked on as
probable inoculations through wounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Successful inoculations were made with blood, lymph gland,
spleen, bone marrow, aqueous humor, serum, œdema fluid, and
testicular juice. The effectiveness of inoculation did not vary
materially with the different fluids used, with the amount, nor
with the point selected for its insertion, subcutaneous, intravenous,
intraperitoneal, or on a mere scratch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Virulence is lost in the dead body in 24 hours or less; when
the infected blood is kept aseptically <i>in vitro</i>, in 3 or 4 days at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>most; or when completely dried. Heating to 122° F. for 30
minutes sterilized, while at 114.8° F. for half an hour the
trypanosoma became nonmotile, but not quite non-virulent.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> <i>Hyperthermia</i> is marked about the time of the
appearance of the infusoria in the blood. (Horse 106.7°; dog
104°; rabbit 105.8°), and in the horse there was a paroxysm
with each new swarm of the parasite. In one ass intermissions
were not observed. In rabbits there was no constant ratio between
the temperature and hæmatozoa, hyperthermia was constant
or nearly so. The horse had marked hyperthermia up to death,
dogs and cats showed a marked descent even to subnormal, before
death.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Anæmia</i> is a marked feature the red globules being greatly reduced,
and they show a tendency to clump in masses instead of
forming rouleaux. The serum added to healthy blood has the
same effect on that. <i>Leucocytosis</i> is not constant nor excessive
(15,000 to 34,000 per c.m. at the highest). In clotting the
blood may form a buffy coat.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Œdema</i> is common in horse, rabbit, cat and dog especially about
the head, legs, belly and genital organs. Rabbits often show
swellings, excoriations and sores of the labia, prepuce and penis
favoring inoculation by this channel.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Conjunctivitis</i> is common in cats, dogs, rats, rabbits, often in
connection with facial œdema, and corneal opacities and ulcers,
and turbidity of the aqueous humor may follow.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Nasal catarrh</i> often interferes materially with breathing.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Muscular wasting</i> and <i>debility</i> are prominent phenomena,
especially in horse, dog, cat and rabbit, the loss of weight
reaching 20 or 30 per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> These are like those of surra. Enlargement of the
lymph glands, spleen and liver, firmness, friability and dark
color of the spleen; effusions, petechiæ, and even hæmorrhages
of the serosæ, lungs and stomach, and great atrophy of the muscles
and adipose tissue are prominent features. The liver is
always fatty in rabbits. In the shafts of the long bones, the fat
is replaced by red marrow. The bone marrow is sometimes red,
at others pale.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>trypanosomata</i> in the blood vary greatly. In infected rats
and mice they appear 3 or 4 days after inoculation, are almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>constantly present thereafter, and as a rule, encrease steadily up
to 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 per c.m. In dogs they appear in 4 to
6 days, in cats in 5, in Guinea pigs in 5 to 7, and in horses in 7
days. In rabbits there were found 60,000 per c.m., in dogs
100,000 to 300,000, and in Guinea pigs 200,000 to 500,000. In
one Guinea pig they did not appear until 6 weeks after inoculation
and then rapidly encreased to a fatal termination. More
commonly a few can be found about a week after inoculation,
and then they disappear for a variable period. They have been
found in the bone marrow when they could not be recognized in
the blood. Again, after subcutaneous flank inoculation in the
rat, they were found in the corresponding inguinal glands 1 to 3
days before they could be detected in the blood. After death
they are found most abundantly in the bone marrow and spleen,
but they have not been found in the intestinal contents nor urine
except in the case of hæmorrhages or local sores.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>No soluble toxin</i> appears to be formed, and <i>no immunization</i> is
effected by the serum. Blood serum kept several days until the
infusoria had died and then passed through a Berkefeld filter had
no apparent effect on the animal economy even in large doses.
Blood heated to 122° F. was equally harmless. The same is true
of extracts of organs and of bile from infected animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>Attempts to secure <i>immunity</i> by injecting the blood serum of
affected animals, after it had been sterilized by heat, filtration,
or standing one week <i>in vitro</i> proved of absolutely no effect.
The blood of the fœtus almost at full term proved valueless, and
the young born of infected mothers proved fully susceptible
when inoculated. The serum of the Guinea-pig, which is
naturally somewhat resistant, proved no protection to other animals.
Bile mixed with infecting blood <i>in vitro</i>, kills the trypanosoma,
but such blood has no protective effect on animals. Sewer
rats and white rats inoculated and re-inoculated with the common
rat trypanosoma (T. Lewisi) until immune from that organism,
show a full susceptibility to the trypanosoma of nagana.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Flesh feeding</i> and <i>vegetable feeding</i> have made no difference in
the susceptibility in the case of rats. Feeding with the hæmatozoa
has produced no immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is evident that prevention must follow the same lines as in
Surra, due consideration being had of the greater number of
genera susceptible.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LUNG PLAGUE OF CATTLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Synonyms. Definition: infectious, cattle fever, with long incubation, insidious
onset, excessive pulmonary exudation, infarctions and sequestra.
History: ancient, modern; England, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, United
States,—its extinction in 1887 to 1892—Massachusetts, New Jersey, S. Africa,
Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand. Causes: contagion only. Bacteriology:
Nocard’s organism cultivated in collodion capsules <i>in vivo</i>, as actively
motile refrangent points, morphology uncertain. Modes of transmission,
exhalations from sick inhaled by susceptible, ingestion of infected food,
pastures, watering troughs, ponds, commingling of herds, attendants, dealers,
stables, manure, unrestricted commerce, convalescent cattle, breed, hot
seasons. Lesions: profuse exudation in lymph networks of lungs, marbling,
parenchymatous cell proliferation, compression and gangrene of lobulets,
thrombi, sequestra, infarction, fibroid sac, or stalactite-like fibroid peribronchial
formations, hepatization, pleural effusions and false membranes, pericardial,
bronchial, lymph glands congested. Incubation: 6 to 30 days, protracted
cases, bearing on quarantine. Symptoms: conditions affecting
gravity, breed, excitement, heat, chill, susceptibility, usually insidious, infrequent
cough, roused by cold water, dusty food, exertion, etc., hurried
breathing when driven, slight auscultation râles, hyperthermia (103° to 108°
F.), dulness, anorexia, suppression of milk, stiffness, no pandiculation,
troubled breathing, auscultation, and percussion signs of extensive consolidation,
tenderness of chest walls, in bad cases stands obstinately, head extended,
mouth open, tongue protruded, grunts with expiration, heavy breath,
nostrils dilated, nasal and buccal discharge, rapid emaciation, fœtid diarrhœa,
erect hair, pale, scurfy, adherent skin, varied chest râles, abortion.
Mild in winter, severe in summer. Loss of one-third or one-half weight in
one week. Chronic cases, fibroid and necrotic changes, sequestra. Diagnosis:
Anamnesis, inoculation: from <i>tuberculosis</i> by high fever, rapid, extensive
infiltration, early succession of new cases, failure to react under tuberculin,
absence of tubercles; from <i>bronchitis</i> and <i>pulmonary strongylosis</i>,
by the succession of cases in place of many at once, the extensive exudation,
the evident cause (exposure or infected place), and by the lesions;
from <i>fibrinous pneumonia</i>, by absence of climatic cause, the more extensive
consolidation, more troubled breathing, and coexistence of old and recent
lesions; from <i>infectious pneumonia</i> by the greater area consolidated, more
exalted hyperthermia, more marked dyspnœa, the absence of white points
of alveolar cell proliferation, and by the old and recent lesions; from <i>septicæmia</i>
hæmorrhagica, by its occurrence at all seasons, on all soils, by the
absence of sanguineous swellings at other parts, by the absence of cocco-bacillus
from the exudate, and by its non-inoculability on sheep, horses,
pigs and rodents; from <i>needle in pericardium</i>, by its epizoötic prevalence,
fever, and the absence of preliminary gastric and later cardiac, morbid phenomena;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>from <i>emphysema</i> by the fever, absence of drumlike tympany, and
presence of consolidation; from <i>aspergillosis of the lung</i> by the fever, more
rapid progress and extended consolidation, by the harmlessness to birds, by
the absence of aspergillus from expectoration and lung; from <i>insolation</i> by
the absence of the causes of heat stroke, of the implication at once of a
number of exposed animals, of the excessive hyperthermia, the brain symptoms
and sudden deaths. Treatment: a poor economy, to be punished
when extinction is attempted. Prevention: importation under three
months quarantine, surveillance of three months more in case of single animals;
applied to lung plague countries and those adjoining; disinfect cars
and boats that have been used in lung plague country; exclude hay and
fodder from lung plague country; also litter, bags, head ropes, horns, hoofs,
hides, hair. To extirpate: stop all ingress of possibly infected cattle, stop
movement of cattle, prohibit common or unfenced pasturage, kill without
indemnity in case of violation, record all cattle, make necropsy of all dead,
kill and pay for all infected herds, disinfect all infected premises and things,
use horses in removing and plowing under manure. Unaided owner may:
breed all his stock, in buying bull quarantine him, allow no intercourse between
his herd and others, get new cattle from herds only that have had no
illness nor losses for a year, and no exposure, and bring by thoroughly safe
route, in disinfected cars or boats, then quarantine, under special attendants.
Immunization; by a first attack, inoculation in tail, intravenous, of sterilized
exudate. Conditions permitting and forbidding immunization.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Synonyms.</i> Bovine Pleuro-Pneumonia, Contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia,

Pulmonea dei Bovina (Ital.), Phush phush pirdaho, Pheepree
(Bengalee).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Definition.</i> An infectious febrile disease, occurring casually
in cattle only, so far as known, and characterized by a prolonged
incubation (10 to 90 days), a tardy insidious onset, inflammation
of the bronchia, lungs and pleuræ, a profuse exudation into the
interlobular connective tissue and chest, a very extensive area of
consolidation, pulmonary infarction, and sequestra.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>History.</i> It is difficult or impossible to identify this disease
among the various animal plagues in ancient times. Yet when
lesions are given it may be admitted in different cases. Aristotle,
writing 350 years before Christ says “the cattle that live in herds
are subject to a malady which causes the breathing to become hot
and frequent. The ears droop and they cannot eat. They die
rapidly and the lungs are found spoiled.” Here the facts that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>cattle alone suffered, that large herds suffered most, that the
lungs were the seat of very marked lesions, and that fever and
mortality were both marked, point forcibly toward lung plague.
Valentini’s description of a fatal lung disease in cattle also stands
out prominently in the obscure records. The first full and
definite report is that given by Bourgelat of its prevalence in
Franche-Compté in 1769. Later the records are frequent and
from all over Europe, indicating its general prevalence before as
well as after Bourgelat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much more important are its definite extensions into new
countries after a long interval of immunity as showing that with
trustworthy records such invasions can always be satisfactorily
accounted for by the introduction of cattle or their fresh products
from a previously infected area. Into Holland it was imported
from Germany in 1835 by Vanderbosch a Guelderland distiller
and spread over the whole country. Attempts were made in
Friesland, and at first successfully, to stamp it out by slaughter
and disinfection, but the demands of the trade toward England
grew so enormously that it was being constantly introduced anew
and the measure was abandoned. The British Consul at the
Hague, in 1839 sent some Dutch cows to a friend in County Cork,
Ireland, which led to the general infection of that island and indirectly
of Great Britain. In 1842, under the Free Trade Act,
England became at once deluged with lung plague cattle from
Holland, Belgium and France on the one side, and Ireland on
the other. Soon the whole island had been infected except exclusively
breeding districts (Welsh and Scottish Highlands, etc.)
into which no cattle were ever introduced from outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1847 an importation of English cattle into Sweden conveyed
the disease, where it prevailed for some time and even infected
Denmark through shipments of cattle, but was finally extirpated
by the pole axe and disinfectants.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1860, Norway imported infected Ayrshire cattle for the
Royal Agricultural College at Aas, but the imported and exposed
stock were promptly destroyed and the previous immunity of the
country has been maintained up to the present.</p>

<p class='c008'>Denmark was infected in 1848 by importation from Sweden,
and on different other occasions from Germany and England, but
by prompt and rigid suppressive measures, stamped out the disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>on each occasion. This was true also of Schleswig so long
as it remained a part of Denmark, but the infection entered in the
commisariat parks of the German army in 1864, and the principality
remaining in German hands, the lung plague became permanently
established.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Oldenburg also maintained vigorous
suppressive measures and for long kept clear of the infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Into Brooklyn, lung plague was introduced in 1843 through the
purchase of an English ship cow by a dairyman (Peter Dunn).
From this centre the infection spread until it prevailed in Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1879, measures were taken in New York and New
Jersey to extirpate the disease but failed to receive the requisite
continued support and were practically abandoned. It
was only in 1887 when the infection had reached Chicago, the
largest cattle market in the world, that the National and State
Governments were aroused to the gravity of the danger, and,
the Federal Government supplying the funds and the Illinois
Government the authority, the beginning of a real attempt
at extinction was seriously undertaken. The author acted as
chief of the national veterinary force in Illinois in 1887, and takes
great pleasure in recording that at the end of three months from
the date of his arrival, the last acute case of the disease had been
disposed of and the frightful danger that had threatened the
nation through the Chicago stock yards had been removed. The
supervision was maintained for a year later, and some old sequestra
were later found in the lungs of cattle slaughtered, but no
acute nor dangerous cases of the disease. This was followed by
vigorous suppressive work in other infected states and by September,
1892, the quarantine was raised and the nation pronounced
free from lung plague. The last cases were met with in New
Jersey, early in 1892. In this last anti-lung-plague crusade the
National Government inspected 1,605,721 cattle in 166,951 herds,
made 356,404 necropsies, purchased 21,961 head of cattle, and
disinfected 4,128 premises. 7,438 cattle were found affected at
the necropsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another line of infection was started by 4 Dutch cows, landed
at Boston in 1859, and before the end of the year the infection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>had extended into 20 different townships in Mass. In 1860, a
State Commission was created, with Dr. E. F. Thayer as veterinary
commissioner, and in the next few years they destroyed
1,164 cattle, and stamped out the plague at a total cost of
$77,511.07.</p>

<p class='c008'>An importation of infected cattle into New Jersey was made in
1847, by Mr. Richardson, who on discovering the nature of the
disease, made an end of that particular contagious centre, by
slaughtering his whole herd at a cost of $10,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>South Africa was infected in 1854 by the landing of a Dutch
bull at Cape Town. As there were no railroads and all inland
carriage was conducted by ox-wagons, it soon spread over the
colonies and extended thence into the native states, and has continued
to the present time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Australia was infected in 1859 through an English cow landed
at Melbourne. When the disease was identified, the whole herd
was slaughtered and paid for, and the farm quarantined. But
the quarantine was broken by a teamster turning his work oxen
into the pastures under cover of night, and the infection escaped
and has prevailed over Australia to the present day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later the disease extended in a similar manner, to Tasmania
and New Zealand.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i> The one essential cause of lung plague is contagion
from a preëxisting case. Before the days of bacteriology, this
had been demonstrated as conclusively as any truth can be. All
extensions into a new country or district could be traced to direct
importation from a preëxisting area of infection. Until such importation
such lands have been immune from time immemorial;
at once after, the infection has spread from the imported animals
as a centre; if the stock is divided up and scattered, several primary
centres are formed from each of which the plague makes
extension. Again, isolated islands (Channel Islands) and purely
breeding districts (Scottish Highlands) into the herds of which
no store cattle from outside are admitted, remain immune through
centuries, no matter how prevalent lung plague may be in the
countries immediately around. The immemorial immunity of
the Western Continent, up to the date of the arrival of the now
famous Dunn cow, the continued immunity of Canada and
Mexico after the infection of the Eastern United States, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>immunity of the United States since the last infected cattle were
destroyed in 1892, are equally conclusive in this respect.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> The history of lung plague forcibly illustrates
how harmless microbes of large size, that may be easily discovered,
and which existing in the environment, readily find their
way into diseased and susceptible parts (in this case into the
bronchia), may be held to be the pathogenic cause. Willems
and Van Kempen, in 1852, found microbes in the exudate.
Lustig in 1885 found four separate microbes in the lesions, 1st, a
short, thick, liquefying bacillus to which he attributed the disease;
and 2d, 3d, and 4th, three forms of micrococcus. Poels and
Nolen, in 1886, demonstrated bacilli of variable size (0.9μ),
solitary, in pairs and chains, cultivable in different media, and
inoculable by injecting such cultures into the lungs, but the resulting
lesions were not marked by the full lung plague exudate.
Arloing, in 1887, separated from the exudate the <i>bacillus liquefaciens
bovis</i>, a very short, slender bacillus, often in pairs with
flagella, motile, staining easily in anilin but not in Gram’s solution,
quickly liquefying gelatine as a culture medium and assuming
a form that might be taken for micrococci, quickly obscuring
peptonized bouillon, and growing on potato. The exudate
placed in a thermostat at 95° F. encreases in potency. The
bouillon cultures injected under the skin or into the lung, produced
characteristic lesions of lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the light of the later experiments of Nocard and Roux in
1897–8, it would appear that Arloing’s bouillon cultures were probably
complex, containing not only the <i>bacillus liquefaciens bovis</i>, but
also, the infinitesimal microbe which is the true cause of the lung
plague. In seeding culture media with the exudate taken with
all possible precaution against contamination, from the interlobular
pulmonary connective tissue, they and others constantly failed
to obtain results. Better success attended their efforts with Martin’s
culture bouillon for producing diphtheritic toxin. Five
pigs’ stomachs are minced, pounded to pulp, mixed as follows:
stomach 200 grs., pure muriatic acid 10 grs., water 50° C.,
1000 grs., left in a thermostat at 50° C. for 12 hours, (to 24), then
heated to 100°<a id='t603'></a>C. to destroy the action of the pepsin, then
lowered to 80° C., alkalized, filtered from flocculi that formed,
heated to 120° C., and filtered. This is then mixed with peptonized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>meat juice prepared as follows: fresh beef or veal, minced
and pulped, 500 grs., and water, 1 litre, are kept for 20 hours at
35° C., the liquid expressed, 5 grs. common salt added, mixed
in equal proportions with the peptonized liquid from the pig’s
stomach, heated to 70° C. to coagulate albuminoids, filtered, alkalized
and sterilized. To this mixture is added ¹⁄₂₅th part of
blood serum (sterile) from the rabbit or cow.</p>

<p class='c008'>This bouillon was inoculated with the pulmonary interlobular
exudate, enclosed in collodion capsules, having very thin walls,
and inserted aseptically into the abdomen of the rabbit. In 15
days the rabbit was sacrificed, and the capsules enucleated from
their envelopes of exudate and cells. The contents showed
the slightest possible shade of opacity, but they contained
neither cells nor any other definite organism. Under a magnifying
power of 2000 diameters the liquid contents were found
to be full of brilliantly refrangent points, actively mobile,
but so minute that their form could not be made out even when
staining was resorted to. The contents of these capsules when
inoculated on cattle produced the unequivocal phenomena of
lung plague infection in a period of from 8 to 15 days. Other
collodion culture cases inoculated from this produced the same
cultures in the peritoneum of the rabbit. Collodion cases
charged with the uninoculated peptonized bouillon, and placed in
the rabbit’s peritoneum remained absolutely clear, with no refrangency
nor motility under high powers and with no infectivity
when inoculated. The rabbits used for the infective cultures
often became emaciated to the last degree and even died, but
their tissues proved in no respect infecting to culture media nor
when inoculated. The attempt to cultivate the germs in collodion
cases in Guinea pigs completely failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ingenious form of culture devised by Metchnikoff for experiments
on the more delicate organisms, has been used by Nocard
to accustom the tubercle bacillus of mammals to grow in the
bird and opens up great possibilities for future investigators.
The collodion, being impermeable to leucocytes and bacteria,
allows these to grow almost together, only on the opposite sides
of the collodion wall, restrains phagocytosis, and protects the
microbe against the destruction which would otherwise overtake it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Modes of transmission.</i> The exhalations from the sick convey
the infection to susceptible healthy cattle. Yet even this was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>denied by one veterinary teacher in Great Britain in the latter
half of the 19th century. The transmission of the disease by
mediate contagion was denied by those in authority in Great
Britain up to the end of the century and this delusion contributed
largely to the loss of many millions by the nation. Experiments
made at Brown Institution were held to sustain this, but not an
atom of evidence was furnished to show that the exposed animals
were susceptible ones. Diseased lungs kept for a year at 21° F.
proved infecting when inoculated (Laguerriere).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Contagion through the air</i> in the same stable was admitted
even by the English sceptics. It may be carried in this way for
forty yards, or if dried on dust or light materials to a great distance.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Infection through food</i> soiled by breath or nasal defluxion is a
common cause. In our great swill stables during the prevalence
of the plague, it was notorious that the disease advanced rapidly
along the line of a feeding trough to the sixty or more animals
using it, and that the rapidity of the advance was determined
largely by the fact that the first animal was at the higher end of
the trough. If at the lower end there was no upward current to
carry infection to the others. <i>Open pastures</i> where the sick have
fed and <i>watering troughs</i> or <i>ponds</i> are common sources of infection.
The permanence of infection in and around large cities is
largely due to the common pasturage by different herds in succession
on the same unfenced lots waiting to be purchased for
building. For this reason the plague always extended in summer
when the cattle frequented these lots, and diminished in winter
when they were strictly confined to stables and yards.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mingling of different herds</i> on <i>great unfenced areas</i> has been
the main cause of the maintenance of the infection from time immemorial
in the hills and forests of central Europe and on the
boundless Steppes of Europe and Asia. This alone is chargeable
with the permanence of the affection, in spite of all efforts for its
extinction, in South Africa, Australia, Tasmania and New
Zealand.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Contagion carried by attendants</i>, <i>cattle dealers</i> and even <i>dogs</i>, is
generally recognized, I have elsewhere quoted the case, in E.
Lothian, Scotland, in which the son of the steward, who was
cattleman on an infected farm, was the means of infecting first, his
father’s cow, and later the whole of the stock on the place; also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>the case at Quincy, Mass., in which a farmer coming straight
from the slaughter of sick cattle, infected his own herd; also the
case of Mr. Jewell, of Long Island, who carried the infection
from the herds visited, to his own family cow in a thoroughly secluded
stable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Infection through infected and emptied stables</i>, was a common
experience in dealing with the lung plague in America. Cows
kept alone and only introduced after the predecessor had died
habitually contracted the disease, though brought, through the
most carefully guarded stockyards, from healthy districts. Stables
have continued infecting for a year after having been vacated,
(Friedberger and Fröhner).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Infection through manure</i> spread on ground to which susceptible
cattle had access was an occasional occurrence.</p>

<p class='c008'>An <i>active, unrestricted commerce</i> is however the most prolific
means of infection in cultivated countries. Slow as the disease
progresses, and long as the animal diffuses infection, it soon attacks
and kills or immunizes all the susceptible animals in the
single herd, and if no other susceptible animal is bought or born
into the herd, the germ in due time loses its pathogenic potency
and infection is at an end. In this way many centres of infection
started in herds on well fenced farms have worn themselves out.
But the case was far otherwise in the city dairies and swill stables.
The trade demanded that the stalls emptied by deaths should be
filled up to consume the swill, or supply the milk route and thus
fresh susceptible cattle were constantly exposed in the infected
stable. The dairy cows were supplied by dealers who charged
exorbitant prices for them and held a chattel mortgage for the
amount. They had come through the infected dealer’s stable,
and if they did not come up to the milk yield promised, they
were either passed on to another dairy or returned to the dealer’s
stable carrying back a new load of infection. The wagons used
to carry the cows through the city were constantly infected and
infecting. The swill stables became the final destination of the
surviving cows that had gone dry and thus infection constantly
gravitated into them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Europe where the great cattle and meat trade with England
and the constant demand for cattle to consume the marc of the
beet sugar and other factories, cause a continuous draught upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>the infected districts the great western centres of enterprise and
commerce have found it impossible to exterminate the plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the country districts in England outbreaks were almost exclusively
confined to the times when fresh cattle were purchased
at one of the great fairs. Hence the late autumn, the period of
laying in feeding cattle, witnessed the greatest extensions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Ireland, as shown by Ferguson, the whole cattle trade
seemed to be arranged as if for the speedy and universal diffusion
of infection. Calves, bought by jobbers from all sources, were
bunched together with every opportunity for intercommunication
and infection. As soon as they were a little further matured,
they were assorted in lots and sent to a fair, where they were
sold, and found their way to great common pastures, and this
process was repeated again and again until they had reached
full maturity. On the way to and from each market they were
quartered over night in a public yard which had just been vacated
by other animals, often diseased, traversed the same roads, and
drank and fed from the same troughs which diseased ones had
just used.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>introduction of apparently recovered cattle</i> is generally
credited with the infection of a fresh herd and Friedberger and
Fröhner quote with approval Walley’s assertion that a recovered
animal with a sequestrum in the lung can infect a herd into which
it is taken. I have failed to produce even local exudate, subcutem
or in the lung, from sequestra which were much more recent,
but the animals operated on were rendered immune and inspired
me to carry out a system of immunization by the use of the
sterilized fresh exudate. The actual date of the expiration of
virulence in the necrotic lung tissue has never been demonstrated
and probably varies in different cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>receptivity</i> of different breeds has been discussed and the
Holsteins and Shorthorns have been thought to show the greatest
susceptibility. These are among the cattle that are most prized,
bought and sold, and exposed to infection. The Shorthorn
especially has a great development of the circulatory system, including
the connective tissue with its great lymph sacs and channels,
and the microbe we are dealing with shows a marked preference
for the lymph system, in which it finds its appropriate field
of development. Susceptibility is greatly encreased by a <i>warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>climate</i> or <i>hot season</i>, under which large herds may die without a
single exception, the disease running a fatal course in two or
three days. In cooler climates 20 per cent. will often escape at
first (French Commission Experiments, 1849).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> If death has taken place early, the lesions are
usually essentially pulmonary, though they may implicate the
pleuræ and mediastinum. In many cases the lung alone is involved,
yet even then the predilection of the microbe for the
lymph network of the interlobular tissue is strongly manifested
in the serous infiltration of that, rather than of the lung structure
proper. This determines the much talked of marbled lung, the
pulmonary lobules standing out at first as a more or less deep red
brown or black, while the marbling is caused by the yellowish or
grayish infiltrated tissue surrounding each pulmonary lobulette
which appear set in, as in mosaic on the surface of a section.
Sometimes a blood extravasation discolors the interlobular exudate
as well, yet it retains its soft liquid appearance which sufficiently
distinguishes it from the firmer lung tissue. These yellowish
interlobular markings vary much in thickness, but in
acute cases this may be up to half an inch or even more. In the
lesions of longer standing the interlobular exudate has usually
coagulated, or even undergone fibroid organization, so that it
compresses and condenses the lobules which it surrounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pulmonary lobules may show the earliest changes of the
alveolar and lobular capillaries, with formation of an exudate,
and an active proliferation of small round cells in and around the
alveoli. Later the exudate coagulates, forming the familiar
red hepatization, and this in its turn may pass into the gray, or it
may liquefy and undergo absorption and resolution. Other
changes are not uncommon. The excess of interlobular exudate
will compress the pulmonary lobules so as to reduce their size
and expel the blood from their structure, giving them a pale
color, or this compression becomes still greater, completely arresting
the circulation and inducing lobular gangrene. Thrombi
in the afferent and efferent vessels contribute to the necrotic
change, and sequestra of varying size, from that of a nut to that
of an infant’s head or larger, are formed. The earliest stage of
this necrosis is usually infarction of the lung, a definite area of
which becomes saturated with dark blood cells so that in contrast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>with the rest of even the hepatized lung, it is almost as characteristic
as the marbling. The further progress of this necrosis is
varied. Most commonly the exudate surrounding the necrotic
mass becomes organized into white fibrous tissue and forms an
investing sac in the interior of which is the dead lung tissue,
showing for a time distinctly, the bronchia, blood vessels, lobulettes,
and interlobular tissue. This gradually becomes detached
and floating in a liquid debris, slowly undergoes solution, and is
absorbed, the sac meanwhile closing in on the cavity. A large
sequestrum may be a year or sixteen months in undergoing complete
solution. In other cases the pulmonary lobulettes undergo
an individual softening while the interlobular tissue becomes organized
and when cut across, the lung presents a distinct honeycombed
appearance. In still other cases a considerable area of
both lobulettes and interlobular tissue is necrosed and liquefied,
while the exudate, around the bronchial tubes, that supplied it,
becomes organized, and on the necropsy the latter are found to
constitute a thick branching mass of a very characteristic appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The newly affected lobulettes have a watery or gelatinoid or
dropsical appearance and if freely incised give out a large amount
of serum and flatten down in doing so. When hepatized the cut
surface is granular, and microscopic examination shows the terminal
bronchia and alveoli filled with a fibrinous exudate containing
great quantities of red blood globules and leucocytes. The distension
of the lung is enormous, so that when the entire organ is
infiltrated it may weigh from 50 to 100 pounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>In recent cases the lung may be extensively affected without
affecting the <i>pleuræ</i>; in other cases both are early involved. In
advanced cases the pleuræ are always implicated. First there is
the subpleural infiltration over the affected part of the lung; later
the pleural surface has reddened arborescent patches, with a
slight solid exudate, and a yellowish (sometimes blood-stained)
serum collects in the bottom of the cavity; later still the affected
portion of the lung is covered more or less thickly with false
membranes, while others cover the organ or the parietal pleura
below this level, and hang in shreds or bind the lung to the ribs.
In old standing and recovered cases these may be largely represented
by dense, white fibrous investments covering the lung or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>the rib, or establishing permanent adhesions. The amount of
pleural effusion may be about two gallons in bad cases, and like
the invasion is either unilateral or bilateral. The <i>pericardium</i> is
usually more or less involved in pleuritic cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>larger bronchia</i> sometimes contain false membranes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>bronchial</i>, <i>prepectoral</i> and <i>mediastinal lymph</i> glands are
often enlarged, congested and infiltrated with an abundant
exudate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Similar infiltration of the lymph glands of the pharynx, mesenteries.
sublumbar region and groin are described, together with
hypertrophy and congestion of the intestinal follicles, and congestion
of the muscles and intermuscular tissue, of the articular and
tendinous synovial sacs, and even of the meninges of the brain
and cord. I know of no facts to show that these conditions result
from anything else than the toxins and the general constitutional
disorder. The indications are that the microbes are speedily
destroyed in the circulating blood, and intravenous injections and
caudal inoculations alike fail to cause the characteristic lesions in
the lung, their favorite point of casual election.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> This usually lasts from 6 to 30 days, being greatly
abridged by hot weather and often prolonged in the cold. Delamotte
claims to have seen it extend to 5 months, and in one case
a calf turned out on Montauk Point, L,. I., from an infected place
was noticed ill on the 104th day. Australia, South Africa and
Norway were each infected by cattle that had been three months
out of their native infected land. I have seen cattle pass three
or four months after purchase in an unthrifty condition, yet without
cough or other recognized diagnostic symptom and then come
down with lung plague. Such doubtless explain the alleged protracted
incubations, the system has been invaded, ill health ensues,
but the lungs are only slightly affected for a length of time. In
other cases one animal in a herd has had a mild attack, which
escaped notice, and it was only later that the disease was recognized
in a second victim, infected from this first.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bearing of this on imported animals is evident. An animal
imported alone should be kept under surveillance for a month
or two after quarantine, while in any considerable herd the disease
would certainly manifest itself during the prescribed three months
detention.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span><i>Symptoms.</i> These vary greatly with the animal and its environment.
Other things being equal it may develop more suddenly
and violently in the obese Shorthorn, Angus, Hereford, Ayrshire
or Dutch, and less so in the spare Brittany or Jersey. In very
hot weather the attack is very sudden and severe. A chill from
exposure, an attack of bronchitis or pneumonia, the excitement
attendant on parturition, on travelling by rail or driving may precipitate
and aggravate the seizure. Under some such conditions
there may be sudden and extreme hyperthermia, rapid pulse, oppressed
breathing, percussion and auscultation evidence of extensive
pulmonary consolidation and death in two or three days,
while the body is still plump and fat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Individual susceptibility appears to have influence, the same
stable presenting simultaneously cases of acute and fatal type and
others that are slow, and insidiously progressive. In newly invaded
countries and in bovine families that have not been exposed
to the infection for many generations the tendency is to a
higher proportion of severe and fatal cases, while in herds native
to districts that have been continuously or frequently exposed,
mild cases tend to predominate. The more susceptible strains of
blood have been killed out, and the surviving strains show a
greater power of resistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Apart from the predisposing environment the tendency of lung
plague is to set in slowly, insidiously, and for a time almost without
outward symptom. For a week, fortnight, month or more
there may be a slight cough heard only at rare intervals and
neither painful nor specially troublesome. Though sometimes
hard, it is more commonly small, weak, short and husky, noticed
only when the animal rises, drinks cold water, goes out to the
cold air, or eats dusty or fibrous fodder, and is usually attended
by arching of the back, extension of the head, opening of the
mouth and protrusion of the tongue. For weeks there may be
no indication of constitutional disorder, appetite, rumination,
milking, and other functions appearing to be normal. Driving
the animal may unduly accelerate the breathing, and a careful
auscultation may detect an unusually loud blowing sound behind
the middle of the shoulder, a mucous râle, or a wheeze. In some
cases the disease never advances farther, the trouble subsides and
the subject is thereafter immune. Cases of this kind occurring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>as the first in a herd, explain some instances of what are claimed
to be specially prolonged incubations.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the great majority of cases further symptoms appear, hyperthermia
sets in, varying in different animals from 103° to 108° F.,
the animal becomes dull, depressed, loses in appetite, rumination
and milking, omits pandiculation on rising, shows stiffness of the
hind limbs, sometimes knuckles forward at the fetlocks, wanders
apart from the herd, is found lying apart, shows extra thirst,
bloats slightly, and shows some constipation. Pulse and breathing
are accelerated, auscultation signs are more marked, and on
percussion, areas of flatness may indicate lobular consolidation,
usually more extended than in ordinary pneumonia with the same
grade of constitutional disturbance. The muzzle becomes hot
and dry, the roots of the ears and horns hot, and the hair stands
erect along the dorsal aspect or in patches over the body. Pinching
of the dorsal spines, sternum or intercostal spaces, may cause
marked wincing and a deep groan. The eye is dull, lacking in
prominence and clearness, and the lids are often partially closed.
At this stage improvement sometimes ensues and after inappetence
and suppression of milk for one or two days, the patient
may take to feeding and milking as before, and apparently
recover, though with a large pulmonary sequestrum.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the continuous and violent cases all the symptoms are aggravated.
Fever may run to its extreme height, there is complete
anorexia and suspension of rumination, pulse and breathing are
rapid, the victim no longer lies down but stands with feet apart,
arms and elbows turned out, head extended nearly on a line with
the neck, mouth open, tip of the tongue projecting, and each
expiration accompanied by a moan, so loud that it may be heard
at a distance (often 50 yards). The breath is heavy, feverish,
mawkish. The flanks heave violently, the nostrils are widely
dilated and discharge muco-purulent, often bloody liquid, strings of
fœtid saliva drivel from the open mouth, there may be tympany or
even colic, the eyes are sunken, and the conjunctiva and nasal
and buccal mucosæ are of a dull brownish and yellowish red.
Emaciation advances at a rapid rate, and the constipation may be
superseded by a profuse, fœtid diarrhœa which wears out the animal.
The skin is dry, scurfy, withered, pale, and clings firmly
to the bones, and the interior of the vulva may show the pallor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>anæmia. The spine, sternum and intercostals are more than ever
tender, and pressure on the tender areas may detect a lack of
movement of the lung which is felt on the healthy parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>On percussion very extensive areas of consolidation are revealed
by the dulness and flatness. If pleuritic effusion exists the resulting
flatness is extreme below and up to a given horizontal level,
the line of which may, however, be elevated at points by consolidation
of the lung at such parts. Auscultation may reveal almost
any of the abnormal sounds of pneumonia or pleurisy. Absence
of respiratory murmur over large areas, with blowing, heart or
abdominal sounds in unwonted situations (where the murmur is
absent), and abnormally loud murmur where the lungs are still
pervious; crepitation around the margins of the consolidated portions;
the creaking sound of stretched false membranes, scarcely
distinguishable from crepitation; mucous râles; wheezing sounds
of various pitches; exceptionally splashing sounds, and if the
animal has just risen, the metallic tinkling sound. In other cases
the pleural friction sound is prominent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abortions are common in pregnant animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Course.</i> This varies greatly. In our northern states in
winter, many would seem to recover after a few days illness; in
summer, many died in a few days with excessive exudate, dyspnœa,
and prostration. Others died early from tympany of the
rumen. In others still, profuse, fœtid, colliquative scouring led
to an early death. In extreme cases there would be a loss of one-third
or one-half the weight in a single week. In the less
rapidly fatal cases all the symptoms became aggravated, the emaciation
progressed, and a liquid pultaceous condition of the
bowels continued for two, three, four, or even six weeks, the animal
finally dying in a state of marasmus. In such cases the
shrunken, pallid skin and mucosæ bespoke an extreme degree of
anæmia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Recoveries may take place from comparatively advanced
stages, but they are liable to be slow and imperfect, the animal
remaining unthrifty for a length of time. In some of the more
favorable cases, when the recovery is less interrupted or retarded,
fattening may take place rapidly, so that it would appear as if
the loss of a portion of lung, and the lessened consumption of
hydrocarbonaceous matter contributed to the deposition of fat.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>In some cases the active morbid processes subside, but are not
quite arrested and the malady assumes a chronic form, the exudates
become organized, causing a sclerotic or fibroid condition
of the lung and especially of the interlobular tissue, which compresses
and carnifies the lung tissue, or leads to necrotic changes
and the formation of sequestra, or again to liquefaction and the
formation of vomicæ. Here the proliferation of the germ may
go on, though little new tissue is invaded, and the animal may
remain infecting for a long period. The patient remains thin,
and weak, is easily blown under exercise, has a small, accelerated
pulse, little power of digestion or assimilation, shows frequent
tympanies, and may have profuse diuresis or diarrhœa. The
cough is frequent, often paroxysmal, easily roused, loose,
mucous, painful and may be attended by muco-purulent discharge.
Such animals are liable to die in the end in marasmus.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some cases the malady is complicated by other infections,
leading to the formation of abscesses in the lungs, pleuræ, chest
walls, bronchial glands, joints or elsewhere, or tuberculous deposits
may complicate the lung plague, and there may be an
early death or a long drawn out decline.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> So many different affections resemble lung plague
closely during life, that a certain means of diagnosis is a great
desideratum. Yet many points help one to reach a reasonably
certain diagnosis:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Does lung plague exist in the country? If not the presumption
is very strongly against it.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Have the suspected animals been recently imported from a
lung plague infected country? or have they been in contact with
animals recently imported from such a country?</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Have they been fed on provender imported from such a
country?</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Have they been attended by a man recently from such a
country and whose clothes have not been sterilized?</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Have they been carried on any imperfectly disinfected car or
ship which has carried the cattle of such country?</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Has the affection attacked a considerable proportion of the
herd at the same time? A rare thing with lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Has the attack come on slowly and insidiously? Very
characteristic of lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>8. Has hyperthermia been marked? Indicative of lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. Have a succession of cases occurred at intervals of several
days or weeks, irrespective of weather? Suggestive of lung
plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. Have the indications of consolidated lung been early and
over extensive undivided areas? Like lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. Have cases been milder in cold dry weather and more violent
in hot and moist? Such is lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. Does the same subject present lung lesions of very different
ages;—infiltration with tough, elastic lung; red hepatization;
gray hepatization; black infarction; sequestra, etc.? Bespeaks
lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>13. Do the infiltration and red hepatization show a marbling
with very extensive filling and turgidity of the interlobular and
subpleural connective tissue, and abundant effusion into the chest?
This is the nature of lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'>14. Does the lung exudate when inoculated in the tail of a
susceptible bovine animal (one that has never had the disease),
produce local inflammation and exudation and procure immunity?
This characterizes lung plague. Does it fail to cause inoculation swelling,
in an animal that had lung plague. Lung plague
is still more indicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>15. If the disease has lasted long enough in a place to determine,
has it affected any other than bovine animals, and does
inoculation of the lung exudate into any other genus of animal
cause the disease? Other genera are immune from lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tuberculosis</i> is distinguished by the habitual absence of the
high temperature, the numerous circumscribed areas of flatness
with wheezing or other abnormal lung sounds, in the midst of a
general field giving the normal respiratory murmur, by the enlargement
or induration of superficial lymph glands, by the response
to the tuberculin test, and by the lung tubercles and
diseased lymph glands,—congested, indurated, caseated, calcified—found
at the necropsy. Inoculation of other genera causes
tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Simple bronchitis</i> is usually connected with climatic change or
exposure, tends to affect a number at once, gives the blowing and
mucous râles, without indications of extended lung consolidation
or pleural effusion, and after death does not furnish lesions of all
ages, recent and remote.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span><i>Verminous bronchitis</i>, attacks the young only or mainly, and
never seriously injures the mature, involves all or nearly all the
young in the herd, shows less hyperthermia, and less extensive
consolidation, more wheezing in the lungs, and a free expectoration
in which the worms (embryos or adults) may be found by
careful search.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Simple fibrinous pneumonia</i> is likely to arise from climatic conditions
or from exposure, attacks several at once and none later,
has less abrupt rise of temperature, less tenderness of the chest
walls, less dyspnœa, less obstinate standing, and after death, less
interlobular exudate and marbling, and no presentation of old
and recent lesions in the same lung.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>infectious pneumonia</i> occasionally seen in western cattle,
the distinction must be made mainly by the less elevated temperature,
less dyspnœa, the lack of the early signs of extensive consolidation
of the affected lung, and after death, absence of the extensive
interlobular infiltration, and in the predominance of the
whitish points or mottling indicating the broncho-pneumonia and
the cell proliferation in the terminal bronchia and alveoli.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pulmonary form of <i>hæmorrhagic septicæmia</i> (Wildeseuche)
is distinguished by its enzoötic character, in connection with wet
lands, its occurrence in the summer season, its association with
other forms of localization, in the abdomen, muscular system, etc.,
its dependence on a cocco-bacillus, easily found in the exudate,
and its inoculability on the smaller ruminants, horses, pigs and
rodents.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>perforation of lungs and heart by a sharp pointed foreign
body</i> from the reticulum, occurs sporadically in one animal which
has usually been kept indoors; it shows as a rule less fever,
may be preceded by tympany or other gastric trouble, shows a
line of consolidation from the reticulum forward, is earlier or
later complicated by morbid heart sounds or rhythm, and commonly
shows a pitting swelling beneath and beside the sternum.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pulmonary emphysema</i> is sporadic only, usually devoid of sudden
hyperthermia, or constitutional disorder, has a dry paroxysmal
cough, wheezing sounds on auscultation, and a drumlike sound
on percussion. If associated with bronchitis or pneumonia and
attendant fever, the case is more equivocal.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Aspergillosis of the Lung</i> usually advances more slowly, in the
comparative absence of sudden hyperthermia, shows more limited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>areas of consolidation, less dyspnœa, and usually affects smaller
animals (birds) as well. At the necropsy the presence of aspergillus
in bronchia and lung tissue is conclusive.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>acute pulmonary congestion</i> of heat stroke is sufficiently
identified by the conditions under which it occurs, its sudden and
rapid progress, the implication of the brain, and its occurrence in
other animals similarly exposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such conditions as <i>atelectasis</i>, <i>pulmonary actinomycosis</i>, <i>distomatosis</i>,
or <i>echinococcus</i>, the <i>congestion of mercurialism</i>, etc.,
should be readily recognized by the attendant conditions, analysis
or necropsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Attempts have been made to diagnose lung plague by securing
a reaction, local or general, as the result of injection of the sterilized
lung exudate or cultures, but they have proved eminently
unreliable. The susceptibility of the serum to change under
manipulation, the existence of hyperthermia before the injection,
and the disposition to local infiltration under the lung plague
poison are apparently insuperable obstacles.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> No treatment has been devised that would warrant
the preservation of the infected animals when the alternative of
prevention is available. The question is an economic one, and with
a disease that is so insidious, with such a long incubation, with so
many occult and chronic cases liable to escape observation and
recognition, and with such a constant and prolonged exhalation
from the lungs of the virulent material and the certainty almost
of the diffusion and preservation of the latter, no more suicidal
policy could be adopted than the preservation and treatment of
the sick.</p>

<p class='c008'>If allowed at all, treatment should be conducted in an isolated
locality, well secluded from visitors and wandering animals including
birds, and under the most intelligent antisepsis. It should
proceed on general principles according to the individual manifestations
of the disease, and might include serum therapy from
immunized animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> For a country like the United States, now happily
free from the lung plague infection, the important object is its
permanent exclusion. For this the federal quarantine for three
months now in force ought to be effective. The only question
would be in the case of small importations of one or two animals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>which might introduce infection under an apparently prolonged
incubation, or with a chronic type of the disease. Small importations
of one or two, might be dismissed at the end of three months
quarantine under a <i>ticket of leave</i> system, under which they and
the herd into which they are taken can be kept track of for three
months more. In the larger imported herds the possibility of the
escape of infection under a three months quarantine is so infinitesimal
that it may be practically ignored.</p>

<p class='c008'>Similar precautions must be taken against the importation of
cattle from a country reputed to be free from the lung plague, but
which imports cattle from an infected country without imposing
the three months’ quarantine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use, for transportation of cattle from one part of an immune
country into another, of cars or boats which have been used for
transporting cattle in an infected country can only be permitted
after the vehicles in question have been thoroughly cleansed and
disinfected and attested so by the official experts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The landing in an uninfected country of hay, fodder, or cattle-food
of any kind, or of litter, grain bags, head ropes, manure, or
other article coming from an infected country must be prohibited
until such article shall have been thoroughly disinfected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Horns, hoofs, hides, hair and other products introduced into
the country must be disinfected. The treatment adopted to exclude
anthrax would be amply sufficient for lung plague.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Measures to Extirpate the Infection.</i> Stop all accessions of
possibly infected cattle from outside. Proclaim the infected area,
prohibiting all entrance and egress of cattle, and all movement
of cattle from herd to herd within the area, except under special
license, based on the soundness of each herd for six months antecedent.
Prohibit absolutely the pasturage of cattle on public
highways and unfenced or insufficiently fenced places. Send to
instant slaughter cattle found in such places in violation of this
rule. Make an accurate census, with individual description of
each bovine animal in the infected district, and make a necropsy
of each such animal dying at the hands of the butcher or casually.
Hold the owner guilty of a misdemeanor with heavy penalty, for
every bovine animal that goes amissing in the infected district
without official post mortem examination. When an infected
animal is found in a herd have the whole herd, marked, appraised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>slaughtered under official supervision and with necropsy of each
animal. If any herd has been losing animals, or had sick animals
within a year, buy and kill the whole herd. Indemnify
the owners to the amount of at least two thirds or three fourths
of the sound market value for all except the advanced and acute
cases of the disease, and such animals as have been moved into the
State less than three months before. These latter may be sacrificed
without indemnity. Disinfect thoroughly all infected
premises and things at public expense. Close the fields against
all outside cattle for three months. Burn all hay, straw, litter,
and grain in the infected buildings or see that they be fed to
horses, sheep or pigs apart from where cattle are kept. Burn or
disinfect all manure or have it drawn out and plowed under by
horses, and the wagons and implements used in doing so
thoroughly disinfected. Allow restocking of the disinfected
premises from sound districts only, and keep up the strictest
supervision and control of the herds for from three to six months.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>For private Control in the absence of Government Action.</i> The
stockowner in a secluded locality, not bordering on a highway or
railway can as a rule secure the immunity of his herd by such
measures as the following. Breed all the stock on the farm. If
a change of blood is required buy the bull young and keep him
strictly by himself for at least four months, allowing him to
mingle with other cattle only after he has been thoroughly attested.
Allow no animals to go outside for service or any other
purpose and afterward return to the herd. Allow none to enter
from without for any such purpose. If from any cause cattle
must be bought, secure them from healthy herds and transport
them in thoroughly disinfected cars, boats and by healthy roads,
and never through an infected district. Place them in special
premises at least one hundred paces from all other cattle, and
under special attendants for three months.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunizing through a First Attack.</i> When lung plague was
at its worst in Great Britain, Mr. Harvey a dairyman on a large
scale in Glasgow practiced the method of buying heifer calves
and exposing them in his infected stables until they contracted
the disease. He had a loss of 20 per cent. and the surviving
80 per cent. were then turned out on his farm and raised and
when they came in milk, were sent into Glasgow as new milch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>cows immunized from the plague. He thus reduced his losses to
the minimum of one fifth of the inexpensive calves, and warded
off the heavy losses previously sustained in the valuable milch cows
and preserved the still more valuable trade in the milk of healthy
animals. The method was a mere temporary makeshift, depending
for its success on the permanent maintenance of the lung
plague, but so long as there were no well considered government
measures for its extinction its permanence was assured in any
case, and Mr. Harvey was working no injury to any one, while
he was substituting a profitable occupation for a losing one, and
supplying his customers with milk from sound cows in place of
those that were continually coming down with the plague. Under
official measures for the plague-extinction his attempt would have
been most reprehensible, but in the absence of such measures it
was highly meritorious.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Inoculation in the Tip of the Tail.</i> This is an advance and in
some respects an improvement on the Harvey system, as the infection
and lesions are localized in the tail, and the mortality is
reduced to 2 per cent. In practice a recently attacked animal is
selected, and a portion of the lung which is strongly infiltrated
but not yet hepatized. This is laid upon a clean scalded plate and
incised with a clean scalded knife when an abundance of a clear
yellow serum drains out. This is drawn up into a sterilized hypodermic
syringe, and the tails having been washed and sterilized,
the nozzle is inserted under the skin of each in succession and a
drop or two of the liquid discharged subcutem. If despatch is
important the washing may be dispensed with and the nozzle
wiped and dipped in strong carbolic acid between each two successive
insertions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Various modifications of this procedure have been made.
To avoid the inevitable entrance of ærial germs, flamed pipettes
have been inserted into a puncture in the turgid lung, made with
a flamed knife, the point is then broken and the serum is drawn
up to fill the vacuum caused by the heat employed in sterilization.
The point is then sealed by melting the glass in the flame of an
alcohol lamp, or by melted wax.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nocard washed the surface of the infiltrated or hepatized lung
with boiled water, then with a sterilized knife cut out a deep
segment so as to leave a conical cavity and covered this with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>awning to keep off dust. The space soon fills with the draining
exudate in a very pure condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pasteur inoculated a calf in the dewlap or behind the elbow,
where an enormous engorgement forms, involving the whole ventral
aspect, and supplying an almost unlimited amount of serum,
which may be collected with such precautions against contamination
as are indicated above. The product is thus secured at a
comparatively cheap rate, and the risk of its diffusion on the air
in breathing is lessened enormously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another method is to employ the serum from the swellings in
the inoculated tails and carry it on indefinitely from tail to tail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arloing in his turn employed the cultures in vitro of his pneumo-bacillus,
but with the modern evidence that this is not the
infective germ, such cultures can not always be implicitly relied
on.</p>

<p class='c008'>In place of the hypodermic syringe, Australians have used a
simple thread soaked in the exudate and drawn through beneath
the skin. Others have used a small lancet with a groove hollowed
out in the middle of the flat surface of the blade on one side, and
which carries in the required drop of the serum.</p>

<p class='c008'>To preserve the exudate for some time against decomposition,
it has been kept on ice, or mixed with chloral hydrate or phenic
acid (½ its volume), and glycerine (½ its volume) for two or
three months.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Injection into the veins</i> practiced by Burdon-Sanderson has the
advantage of producing no local lesion whatever and yet securing
a fair measure of immunity. It is, however, a much more delicate
operation as it entails a possible though remote possibility of
producing capillary thrombi, and some danger of infection of the
wound in the vein. To avoid this latter, the jugular vein is
raised as for phlebotomy, and a short needle is passed into it. A
longer and more delicate needle is now passed through this, and
the injection of a few drops of the exudate is made through the
latter. The small needle is then carefully withdrawn to be
followed a few seconds later by the large.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Injection of the Sterilized Exudate Subcutem.</i> In 1881 having
found that liquids obtained from old sequestra, produced no local
lesions when inoculated subcutem, but secured immunity for the
subjects, I inoculated ten susceptible cattle with the fresh pulmonary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>exudate which had just been heated for 30 minutes to
180° F. No local inflammation nor exudate occurred in any of
them, but subsequent inoculations with fresh unsterilized lung
plague exudate were resisted in the same way. Six of these immunized
cattle were subsequently placed in two infected stables
and herds, (Mr. Butts, Brooklyn, N. Y., and Mr. Christopher
Slade, White Hall, Baltimore Co., Md.) and retained there for
three months without showing the slightest indication of disease.
Later I applied the measure on a number of herds with thoroughly
satisfactory results. About ten years later a similar resort was
had by Arloing and Rossignol with corresponding success.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two advantages come from this method: 1st, there is no local
infection and no marked swelling so that the injection can be
made on the side of the neck where the skin is thin, and clean,
and the connective tissue abundant, and where there is less risk
of extraneous infection than in the too often dirty or filth soaked
tail; 2d, as no living germ is introduced there is no possibility of
propagating the disease to other neighboring susceptible animals.
Two per cent. of loss, of animals inoculated by the Willem’s
method is counted on, but with the sterilized virus there is not
even a remote probability of loss. Infection cannot occur from
the animal injected with the sterilized virus, so that it can be
safely applied among cattle that have not been exposed to infection,
but which are likely to be in the future, and these injected
cattle can be left to mingle with others that have not been injected
without a shadow of danger to either.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Conditions permitting and forbidding Immunization.</i> Immunization
is permissible or commendable in all cases in which
lung plague is already widely spread in a land destitute of fences
and in which cattle roam at large, and herd mingles freely with
herd. Here the extension of the disease is inevitable and continuous
and effective measures for extinction are impossible. It is
permissible where the plague is widely spread among cultivated
and fenced farms, but where no authoritative measures are in
force for its extinction. In such case, with the Willem’s system
the inoculated herd should be kept thoroughly secluded in
premises or well fenced pastures, apart from any highway, and
not adjoining any other cattle pasture.</p>

<p class='c008'>When on the other hand official measures are in force for the
extinction of lung plague, every form of immunization based on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>the production of the pathogenic germ in the living body of the
bovine, or even in vitro, is to be unqualifiedly condemned. The
risk of the escape of the infection through subtle, unsuspected
channels is too great to allow of its reproduction in any form.
By restriction of cattle movement, slaughter and disinfection,
extinction of lung plague is easy and certain, but, whatever may
be true of an individual herd, no country has ever permanently
extinguished lung plague infection, when the virus was systematically
multiplied for uses in inoculation.</p>

sudden invasion, rapid advance, hyperthermia, great constitutional
disorder, congestion and blood extravasations of the mucosæ

<span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>arrested inspiration, followed by an expiratory moan, and by an
early and very high mortality.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Historic Notes.</i> As the most rapidly developing and deadly of
the cattle plagues, this attracted the greatest attention of people
in earlier times, and thus its invasions and ravages can be more
satisfactorily identified, than those of the tardier and somewhat
less deadly lung plague which usually followed in its wake.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sanctus Severus and Vegetius Renatus indicate its advent into
Western Asia on the borders of the Caspian and Black Seas, coincident
with the irruption of the Mongols in the first Christian
century. It still prevails in China and adjoining countries, including
Hindoostan, and since that date the Steppes near the
Black and Caspian Seas have been looked on as the perennial
home of the plague. Before 376, A. D., the chronicles of epizoötics
in Europe suggest anthrax affections which prevailed
widely in man and beast, and since that time the special plagues
of cattle come into prominence. At this date the Huns began a
great onward movement from the region of the Caspian and Black
seas into Dacia (Hungary), Northern Italy, Germany and Gaul,
and this was the occasion for a general diffusion of Rinderpest
over these countries.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this date cattle plague spread widely on the occasion of
any great European war in which the eastern nations were involved
or which was so general or continued as to draw upon Eastern Europe
for the supply of the commisariat parks. One great epizoötic
culminated in 810 after the wars of Charlemagne; one occurred in
820 in connection with invasion of Hungary by the Franco-German
army; one in 1223 to 1225 laid waste Central Europe and
is said to have reached Great Britain; in 1233–4 it again gained a
wide extension following the invasion by hosts of Mongols from
Siberia; great extensions are recorded in Italy in 1616 and 1625
during the 30 years’ war; in 1709 Charles XII wintered with his
army in the Ukraine and his return was followed by the most disastrous
mortality ever seen in Europe and which lasted from 1710
to 1717. This reached England in 1714 and was there stamped
out by killing and burning the sick, disinfecting the buildings
and closing up the infected pastures. Paulet claims that Europe
lost 1,500,000 head of cattle in the first three years of this invasion.
It continued more or less prevalent in the eastern countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>of Europe, and, following the course of war, entered Italy in
1735, and extended westward. Again in 1740 in connection with
the war of the Austrian Succession it extended westward invading
the Western Countries from France to Denmark inclusive,
and once more extended into England, where it prevailed until
1756 and caused an unprecedented destruction. It was finally
stamped out as on the previous invasion. During this invasion
Europe lost 3,000,000 head of cattle (Delafond). In 1770 another
invasion of Great Britain occurred through the landing of
infected Dutch hay at Portsoy, N. B., but this was quickly suppressed
by the destruction of every bovine animal in the infected
herds, and the thorough disinfection of premises, supplemented
by a daily scrutiny of all cattle within a radius of 18 miles. In
the second half of the 18th century cattle plague prevailed more
or less generally in all Continental Europe, except Norway, Sweden
and the Spanish peninsula, into which no cattle were imported,
and carried off 200,000,000 head of cattle (Freidberger and Fröhner).
In 1796 to 1816 the cattle plague followed the marches and
countermarches of the various armies in connection with the
French revolution and the Napoleonic wars, causing unheard of
losses throughout Europe. In 1827 it spread widely in connection
with the war of independence in Greece, and again in 1830–1
a wide extension occurred in connection with the Polish revolution.
In 1844 Russia lost 1,000,000 head of cattle. In 1841 a
shipment of Roumanian and Anatolian cattle to Alexandria,
Egypt, carried the plague and in two years upwards of 350,000
head of Egyptian cattle perished, only a few being left. From
this date the great development of manufactures in the Western
European nations, and especially in Great Britain, the consequent
increasing demand for beef, and the inauguration of rapid transit
from Eastern Europe by steamer and rail, introduced an era of
the extension of the cattle plague by commerce rather than war,
and Röll gives the losses in Austria alone in 1847 to 1864 at
500,000 head. In 1865 a cargo of cattle from Revel on the Baltic,
landed the infection at Hull, whence it speedily extended over the
entire country, and prevailed for 18 months, but was stamped out
by vigorous measures of destruction and disinfection. In all
279,023 head were reported attacked of which 233,629 died or were
killed and 40,165 recovered. In 1865 the plague was once more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>imported into Egypt, this time from the Danubian Principalities.
A wide extension took place in the parks of the French and German
armies in the war of 1870–1, as many as 43 departments in France
having suffered. In 1872 it was imported from Russia into Great
Britain but was speedily extirpated, and again in 1877 from Germany
when it spread somewhat more widely but was easily suppressed.
In 1881 it was introduced into S. Africa in Asiatic
cattle during the war in the Transvaal and coming after the long
continued prevalence of lung plague it threatened the cattle interests
with ruin. In 1890 it reached Abyssinia by cattle sent for
the supply of the Italian Army. In 1892 Japan suffered through
importation from the main land. The latest extension of cattle
plague was in 1898–9 into the Phillipines in the shipments of
Asiatic cattle sent for the supply of the American army, and there
as elsewhere in unfenced countries it is proving the cause of disastrous
losses.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Animals Susceptible.</i> In spite of its name—cattle plague,
Rinderpest—this affection is not like lung plague peculiar to
bovine animals. Yet bovine animals are by far the most susceptible,
by them it is mainly propagated, and upon them comes the
greatest mortality. Infection, however, extends to all other ruminants,—sheep,
goats, deer, elk, antelopes, gazelles, aurochs,
yaks, camels, dromedaries, buffaloes, etc. Swine which show a
pouch on the left sac of the stomach show a certain susceptibility,
it killed the peccaries in the Jardin des Plants, Paris, and Viseur
in France and Pluning in Sumatra, claim to have seen cases in the
domestic pig. The horse, dog, rabbit, bird, and man are immune.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> In a disease with such destructive changes in
blood and tissues, bacteria are found, almost of necessity, in the
seats of the lesions and even in the blood. No constant microörganism
has, however, been isolated, cultivated in artificial
cultures, and successfully inoculated on other and susceptible
animals. Saweljeff isolated sporulating motile bacilli which break
up into micrococci and streptococci, with the cultures of these
on agar he produced what he believed to be cattle plague.
Metchnikoff found a short bacillus with rounded ends, forming
cocci and leptothrix-like threads, non-liquefying, and producing
cattle plague in calves. Sacharow found a bacillus 0.25μ to 1.5μ
long and Tokishige a very small short bacillus the cultures of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>produced rinderpest in cattle. It would seem as if here as in the
case of lung plague, the experimenters had retained the real but
invisible pathogenic agent in what they took for pure cultures.
Semmer attributes the disease to fine corpuscles which have so far
eluded current methods of staining and cultivation, and that they
exist in the number of from one to six in the enlarged cell
nucleus. Nicolle and Adel Bey sustain this position, having found
that the unseen virulent germ passed through the more open and
thinner Berkefeld filter, but failed to traverse the denser Berkefeld
and Chamberland porcelain filters even when favored by a somewhat
higher temperature. As this filtration usually removes the
germ and renders the liquid noninfecting they hold that the real
germ is almost certainly intraleucocytic. When in exceptional
cases a few pass through the filter it is held to be only such as
were free in the liquid, and these are usually so small in number,
that inoculation with the filtrate does not kill, nor always produce
appreciable symptoms, but only immunity.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Accessory Causes.</i> The essential cause being the germ, accessory
causes are of necessity such as contribute to the preservation
of that microbe and its introduction into the systems of susceptible
animals.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Susceptibility</i> has a powerful influence even in races habitually
subject to rinderpest. The highest susceptibility inheres in cattle,
and yet the surviving cattle of the Steppe race, which has
been exposed to the infection for centuries, mostly recover from
the plague, while fresh cattle imported into the Steppes perish
almost without exception. Sheep and goats contract the disease
but it is more severe and deadly in the latter than in the former
animal. Both, however, can carry the infection back to the bovine
animal, as can also the whole group of ruminants. The Guinea pig
contracts the affection by inoculation and may thus become an indirect
means of conveying infection from ox to ox.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Immunity</i> follows a first attack. Calves born of cows that
passed through cattle plague during the last months of gestation
are usually immune.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Exposure to infection</i> arises in various ways. All of the secretions
of the diseased animal are apparently infecting, and the
virus possesses great vitality, so that the channels of infection are
almost endless. It is carried in the manure, washed on in streams,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>and drains, dried up on hay, straw, feathers and other light
objects, or in dust, and blown about by the winds, left in stables,
in feeding and watering troughs, in railroad cars, steamboats,
ferry boats, loading banks and yards, it is carried in the fresh
milk, flesh, fat, sausage cases, hairs, hoofs, horns, wool and
bristles, in hides and bones, in halters and harness, on wagon
shafts and poles, on goads, on boots and clothes of men, and the
feet of dogs, birds and other animals, on the wheels of vehicles,
the runners of sleighs, and by vermin and wild animals. The
various infected products, however, soon lose their virulence after
drying. Galtier assures us on the basis of the experiments of
a Russian Commission, and the experience of France, Belgium,
England and other countries that dried or salted hides can be
introduced with perfect safety, and that rendered suet, and dried
skins, horns, bones and hairs are equally harmless. On stalls,
mangers and racks on the other hand, in an obscure and still
atmosphere, virulence may be preserved for three months (Müller,
Dieckerhoff). Again in litter and manure in the open air, and
even in yards and pastures it may retain its vitality for weeks
(Chauveau). The infection is destroyed by a temperature of
zero, or 131° F. (Semmer).</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever determines a movement of animals from an infected
locality, determines the extension of the plague, hence war, and
commerce, the food demands of a large and encreasing manufacturing
population, the inauguration of new routes of rapid transit
by steam over land or sea all contribute in their various ways to
the extension of rinderpest.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The most significant feature of the morbid lesions is
their concentration on the fourth stomach, small intestine, rectum,
oral cavity and vagina. The respiratory apparatus, eyes, skin,
muscles, and nervous system suffer to a lesser extent. If the case
has gone on to a fatal result there is usually marked emaciation,
the natural openings (mouth, nose, eyes, anus) are soiled with
morbid discharges (muco-purulent, feculent) the thighs smeared
with offensive liquid fæces, and the skin may be yellowish red, or
dark, with a general scurfy condition and distinct eruptions,
especially of rounded wart-like epidermic concretions on teats and
udder. The eyes are deeply sunken, the conjunctiva of a yellowish
red, and the lips and muzzle dry, swollen and it may be
eroded.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_630'>630</span>The buccal mucosa is swollen, fœtid, with marked epithelial
desquamation and more or less deep and extended erosions on the
upper and lower lips, gums, dental pad of the upper jaw, cheeks,
hard palate, and root of the tongue. There may still be some of
the characteristic, white, epithelial concretions, or the epithelium
may hang in loose semi-detached shreds, or there may be extensive
areas of abrasion, in transverse cracks or broad patches, and
finally extensive petechiæ. The conical papillæ on the cheeks
and dorsum of the tongue are especially liable to dark red petechial
discolorations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subderma and submucosa are also suffused with these congestions
and petechiæ, and like the epidermic layer show a marked
increase of all elements and of the cell nuclei.</p>

<p class='c008'>The congestions, petechiæ, desquamations, erosions, are found
on the fauces, pharynx, gullet, nasal mucosa, trachea, and bronchia,
to a greater or less extent in different cases. There may be
even limited areas of superficial necrosis and even the formation
of false membranes. In the diseased epidermis and epithelium,
in the necrotic plaques and false membranes there are spores and
mycelia of fungi and bacterial growths.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the rumen, reticulum and manifolds, the mucosa and submucosa
usually show limited areas of thickening and punctiform
or arborescent congestion with softening and even detachment of
the epithelium.</p>

<p class='c008'>The abomasum is profoundly involved, especially in the vicinity
of the pylorus. The folds are of a deep blood red or purple, or
blackish, port wine hue, or they may be in part brownish red, or
when necrotic, slate colored or mottled. The peptic glands are
swollen, elevated and dilated, and patches and spots of softened
and loosened epithelium are easily detached leaving a deep red
surface with, it may be redder oozing points. Ulcerous sores may
show on the summits of the folds. The contents are a viscous,
fœtid grayish yellow, or reddish liquid, without solid ingesta.</p>

<p class='c008'>The small intestines show similar lesions, deep, dark red congestions,
most intense on the summits of the folds, softened,
loosened, ragged patches of epithelium, erosions, ulcers, circumscribed
sloughs, casts of the gut formed by desquamating epithelium,
and congested, enlarged, and prominent aguimated and
solitary glands are more or less in evidence. The contents are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>liquid and yellowish, grayish or reddish and fœtid. Microscopically
the distension of the glands, (of duodenum, Lieberkuhn
and Peyer), the proliferation and softening of the epithelium,
the enlargement of the nuclei of these and of the cells of
the submucosa, and the profusion of microörganisms are marked
features.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the cæcum and colon the lesions are usually less prominent,
though swelling, softening and desquamation of the epithelium
often exists, and points and patches of congestion, ecchymosis,
and necrosis are not uncommon, particularly in the cæcum, and
may extend to the muscular layer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The terminal portion of the rectum is especially liable to
marked congestion and blood extravasation, with more or less
desquamation and erosion. The summits of the mucous folds are
often of a dark red (port wine) hue, and as this is everted and
exposed in defecation or later by the relaxation of the sphincter
it becomes a marked lesion even in life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spleen is normal in strong contrast with anthrax in which
similar gross lesions are often found on the mucosæ and especially
the rectum.</p>

<p class='c008'>The liver is usually rather pale and soft, as in other cases of
high fever and centres of necrosis may be present. The gall
bladder contains a variable amount of thin bile. The pancreas is
nearly or quite normal. The lymph glands generally and especially
those of the mesentery and abomasum are congested, enlarged
and softened.</p>

<p class='c008'>The kidneys are congested, often petechiated, swollen and
softened, with centres of necrosis. The bladder, vagina and
uterus show mucous congestion, and thickening uniformly or in
spots with muco-purulent secretion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lungs show spots of hyperæmia, extravasation and at times
hepatization, but a very characteristic lesion is the interlobular
emphysema already referred to as connected with the abdominal
pain and the sudden arrest of inspiration. This gives a gross appearance
of marbling as in lung plague, only in this case the
inflated interlobular tissue is dark colored instead of white as in
lung plague, and it collapses at once when incised.</p>

<p class='c008'>The encephalon, medulla and nerves present more or less
hyperæmia and even exudation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>The heart is usually pale except in the spots infiltrated by
blood, but it may be mottled with petechiæ and particularly on
the endocardium. The pericardial fluid is often red. The blood
is at first little altered, but later undergoes marked changes,
notably an increase of fibrine (50 per cent.) and a decrease of
water (as in Asiatic cholera). There is marked leucocytosis, and
distortion of the red globules. Before death it becomes black and
incoagulable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole capillary system tends to be relaxed and over-distended
(congested).</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Incubation.</i> As seen in England the incubation was from four
to five days. Four to nine days are claimed by Galtier as the
extremes, yet he quotes incubations apparently as short as 12, 24,
36 and 48 hours respectively. A source of fallacy rests in the prevalence
of cattle plague in the district and the possibility of infection
through unsuspected channels, before the recognized exposure.
Something must also be allowed for the greater susceptibility and
the larger dose of the poison which would tend to shorten the incubation.
Thus the western improved breeds, which suffer a mortality
of 80 to 95 per cent. (Refik Bey), and the winter season, when
the virus is concentrated in small ill ventilated houses, both tend
to shorten the incubation. At the Albert Veterinary College in
1865, Gerlach went direct from the infected stable to the sound
one, and in 48 hours several of the cattle in the latter had a manifest
rise of temperature. Roloff observed the elevation of temperature
in 36 hours after exposure, and Ranpach and Ravitsch as
early as 11 hours after the inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The earliest symptom is abrupt hyperthermia,
(104° to 108° F.). This is virtually pathognomonic in a herd or
locality in which the disease exists, or in suspected animals presumably
coming from an infected region. The temperature usually
rises to its height on the third or fourth day, and falls materially
when other symptoms are developed. In some instances
death supervenes during the high temperature, but in the majority
the temperature goes below the normal before death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Often on the second day, or the third, white epithelial eruptions
or concretions appear on the inner sides of the lips, closely resembling
the eruption of muguet (thrush) and often showing also on
the dental pad of the upper jaw and along the gums of the lower.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>In connection with the high temperature, which is absent in
<i>thrush</i>, this symptom is virtually pathognomic. These concretions
are more or less abundant in different cases, sometimes so slight
as to be easily overlooked, and in other cases encreasing up to the
sixth day, and covering not only the lips, dental pad and gums,
but extending back over the hard palate, pharynx and gullet.
The concretion is as soft as cream cheese, easily detached and
leaves a bright red abrasion (not ulcerated) when removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the fourth day there are dry or staring coat, sometimes
rigors, sometimes small, accelerated pulse (60 to 120 per minute),
some loss of appetite and impairment of rumination, dry muzzle,
a general flush of the mucosæ (mouth, vagina, rectum), and
deep blood red discoloration of many of the buccal papillæ.
There is weariness or debility, the animal remaining down much of
the time, also marked thirst, constipation, the fæces covered with
mucus or blood, rapidly advancing emaciation, and marked tenderness
of the skin, especially of the loins. The head and ears are
drooped, saliva drivels, the mouth has a fœtid odor, the eyes
weep, and there may be grinding of the teeth. The skin may
be hot and the white and delicate parts (udder, teats) suffused
by a deep blush. The milk is decreased at first and finally completely
dried up.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the malady advances the belly becomes tender, the constipation
is succeeded by diarrhœa with much attendant rumbling, the
fæces are at first watery, greenish and acid, and later highly
offensive, yellowish brown or gray, and alkaline. These become
encreasingly profuse, fœtid and liquid, assuming perhaps a pea
soup or rice water consistency before death. The sphincter, at
first firm and quickly responsive, finally undergoes permanent
relaxation, with constant exposure of the dark red mucosa.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease is fully established the respirations often become
highly characteristic. There is not the sudden catching
and shortening of the inspiration as in pleurisy, but a sudden
closure of the glottis with an audible clicking sound in the course
of the expiration, and, after a perceptible interval of holding of
the breath, the expiration is resumed with or without an accompanying
moan. This phenomenon is so characteristic as to
be largely diagnostic. Whether it is due to abdominal pain
roused by the sudden forward movement of the diaphragm, or to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>nervous disorder alone, it is a valuable symptom always to be
looked for.  It further explains the interlobular emphysema
usually met with in the lungs in this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the more violent cases death supervenes from the sixth to
the ninth day, but in the indigenous breeds of Eastern Europe
and Asia, which represent a <i>survival of the fittest</i>, the great
majority suffer mild attacks and recover, and even in newly invaded
countries, when the invasion has spent itself and the less
susceptible are largely attacked, a fair proportion survive for a
longer period and even recover.</p>

<p class='c008'>In these milder, protracted, or surviving cases the skin symptoms
are likely to come out prominently. Chief among these and very
constant at the height of the disease is an abundant unctuous
exudation which dries on, forming a crust, comparable to what is
seen on the skin in the fevers of swine. At different points,
notably on the teats, udder, inner sides of the thighs, and arms,
and on the neck, lips and face generally, are epidermic concretions
having a warty-like appearance, and respectively seated on a very
slightly swollen and congested point of the dermis. The deeper
layers of these epidermic concretions often soften, so that they
have been mistaken for vesicles and pustules, and hence the error
by which cattle plague was held to be but a malignant form of
cowpox. But these concretions are histologically distinct from
vesicles; there is no liquid exudate on the papillary layer raising
the epidermis in the form of a little sac, but merely an excessive
production of the cuticular cells with abnormally large nuclei,
as happens generally to cells in active proliferation, and an
admixture with those of spores and mycelium of fungi which
have no special significance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Papules, vesicles and pustules may form on the diseased skin
and are described by different authors, but they are not characteristic
of the disease as are the epidermic proliferations.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some rare cases nervous symptoms appear, the animal moves
unsteadily without proper sense of balance, it may toss its head
and horns as if attacking an enemy or it may sink into a somnolent
or comatose condition. Wasting advances rapidly, abortion occurs
in pregnant females, the weakness becomes extreme, the animal
remains constantly down, unable to rise, rests his head on the
ground, breathes heavily and stertorously and perishes with or
without convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span><i>Diagnosis in Cattle.</i> Individual symptoms of cattle plague may
be found in other diseases, but the aggregate symptoms, in a
rapidly spreading and fatal affection, and connected with a previous
prevalence of the disease in the country or district, or distinct
evidence of the introduction of infection should in every case
obviate error. The chief diagnostic symptoms are: a sudden,
very marked rise of temperature; a congestion or blush of the
visible mucosæ generally (mouth, nose, vulva, eyes); the formation
of white curd-like epithelial concretions on the inside of the
lips, dental pad, or gums of the incisors; the formation of red
spots or petechiæ on the mucosæ; later the desquamation of the
softened epithelium with the formation of erosions or even ulcers;
the wart-like rounded epidermic eruptions on the skin; the great
abdominal tenderness with tucking up of the abdomen, and sudden
arrest of the expiration with a sharp clicking sound and
moan; the fœtid, watery diarrhœa and exposure of the dark red,
congested and hæmorrhagic rectal mucosa; the discharge from
nose, mouth and eyes; the characteristic fever odor; and the rapid
progress of the disease from animal to animal, and to a fatal issue.
The rapidly advancing contagion and its fatality in cattle, sheep
and goats, together with the immunity of horses, dogs, birds and
human beings are important elements in diagnosis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Malignant Catarrh of Cattle</i> is distinguished by the absence of
active contagion, one or two only in a herd being attacked; by
the absence of the curd-like concretions on lips, dental pad, and
gums; by the involving of the matrix of the frontal horns; by the
great congestion, swelling and discharge from the eyes; and by
the impossibility or improbability of the cattle plague contagion
in the particular locality. In localities where cattle plague actually
prevails, it may sometimes be impossible to distinguish at
first, and then every precaution should be taken to prevent diffusion
of infection in case it should be cattle plague.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Thrush</i> of the mouth, though causing an eruption of the same
kind, occurs in sucklings only, is unattended by fever, marked
congestion, or severe abdominal symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Foot and Mouth Disease</i>, though equally contagious, and spreading
with the same rapidity, is easily distinguished by the very
slight hyperthermia, the vesicular character of the mouth and
mammary eruption (the cuticle being raised by an abundant clear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>straw-colored liquid exudate); by the absence, in nearly all cases,
of severe abdominal disorder; by the all but constant vesiculation
of the interdigital space, and by its mild and non-fatal issue.
Swine contract it as readily as cattle and sheep, and horses, dogs,
birds and men by inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dysentery</i> is marked by the absence of the early, abrupt hyperthermia,
though the temperature may rise gradually to a high
point; also of the curd-like concretions on the buccal mucosa; by
the earlier onset of the fœtid diarrhœa, and by the indisposition
to contagious diffusion apart from the confined, foul, crowded
buildings. The lesions are mainly on the large intestines while
in cattle plague they are on the small intestines, fourth stomach,
mouth, throat and skin.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Gastro-enteritis and Stomatitis</i> from corrosive agents and irritant
bacteria, can be traced to a definite local cause, do not extend
beyond the herd or animal poisoned, and usually occur where the
possibility of cattle plague can be excluded. There is usually an
entire absence of the white epithelial concretions, of the blush of
the mucosæ generally, and of the wart-like epidermic proliferation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Anthrax</i> of the alimentary tract and rectum is distinguished by
the fact that it is largely an enzoötic disease, not spreading widely
by simple contact; that it is easily transmissible to horse, dog and
man; that it lacks the buccal epithelial concretions and characteristic
desquamations and the warty-like skin products; that it
shows marked enlargement and engorgement of the spleen; and
that the blood and local lesions contain the large sized, square
ended anthrax bacillus.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis in Sheep and Goats.</i> This is based on the same
phenomena as in cattle; the sudden and exalted hyperthermia,
blush or petechiæ of the visible mucosæ, concretions on the lips,
gums and skin, epiphora, salivation, prostration, emaciation and
diarrhœa. These last symptoms are, however, less marked than
in cattle and the mortality and infectiousness are materially reduced.
Pneumonic complications are much more common in
sheep.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mortality.</i> Among native cattle in the Steppes the mortality
is 30 to 50 per cent. whereas elsewhere it is 90 to 95 per cent.
Among sheep in Austria it reached 60 to 66 per cent. Among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>camels in Asia and Africa the fatality proved as high as among
cattle. The Italian buffalo usually recovered after seven days
illness.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> The therapeutic treatment of cattle affected with
cattle plague has been eminently unsatisfactory and is so certain
to become a means of extension of the disease that it is legally
prohibited in all countries, in which the plague has not been allowed
to become generally diffused. Where it has become general
in an unfenced country in which accordingly its permanence is
virtually ensured, it may be employed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Serum-therapy</i> is advocated by Refik Bey. An animal is hyper-immunized
by repeated inoculations. His blood is then withdrawn
and the serum obtained from it is injected in a dose of
25cc., subcutem, at a temperature of 104° F. The temperature
is taken from the 3d to the 5th day and if it does not at this time
rise above normal the treatment is ended. If still above normal
a second dose of 25cc. is given. It is claimed that the serum is
harmless and may be safely given in a single dose of 50cc. in
case it is impossible to keep watch of the animal for five days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention by Immunization.</i> Semmer attempted this by inoculating
cattle with virus which had been weakened by heat or by
passing it through the body of a Guinea pig. The results were,
however, far from perfect and even in Russia the method failed of
any wide acceptance. Koch and Edington in South Africa
practised extensive inoculations with a mixture of the virus in
bile. Still better results are claimed by Danyoz, Bordet and
Theiler in the Transvaal. These treated the animals by injecting
25cc. to 50cc. of highly immunized blood, defibrinated, and
while the subjects were thus rendered temporarily insusceptible,
they were exposed to infection by contact with diseased animals.</p>

<p class='c008'>As with serum-therapy, measures of this kind are only permissible
in a country in which cattle plague is already generally
diffused, and where there are no fences to limit the continued
diffusion of the infection. The preservation of the cattle
artificially infected until highly immunized, and again of the sick
cattle requisite to give the disease to the cattle operated on, and
finally of these last through the mild attacks that are to render
them immune, affords an endless number of loopholes for the
escape of contagion which would forbid the adoption of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>method whenever the extinction of the disease is possible. When
on the other hand a disease is already spread universally in a
country destitute of fenced enclosures, in which herd mingles
with herd in the most perfect freedom, and where accordingly
extinction is impossible, the method is admissible and even commendable
as a means of reducing the otherwise ruinous mortality.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Exclusion and Extinction of Cattle Plague.</i> For countries
adjoining lands infected with cattle plague such general measures
as the following are imperative: Prohibition of all imports of
cattle, sheep and other ruminants, camels and swine from such
infected countries, also of the fresh hides and other products of
such animals, and of litter, fodder and other things that may have
been stored in the buildings with infected cattle or otherwise
soiled by them. Prohibition of imports of all cattle or other
ruminants from adjacent countries (which may be plague-free),
but which animals have been carried in undisinfected cars
or boats that had been in previous use for such species of animals
drawn from infected countries, or that had been passed through infected
countries, yards, buildings, loading banks, chutes, piers,
gangways, or other places, or furnished with fodder, halters
or appliances from such infected localities. In Eastern Europe
the practice is to patrol the frontiers day and night to prevent
the smuggling of cattle through from the infected country. Infected
animals or herds, that it is sought to pass, are turned
back or slaughtered. Sheep from countries that had been previously
infected are often admitted on affidavit of the official
veterinarian in the country from which they come, that during
the three months before they left, there had been no contagious
disease of cattle nor sheep in the locality, and on the further condition
that they shall be slaughtered at the point of entry, or, if
brought by rail, at the nearest slaughter house approached by
such railroad after entry. In France, sheep, sent from Russia
by sea, in French bottoms, certified as above by the Russian authorities,
and accompanied on the voyage by a French veterinarian
and certified sound by him, are allowed to circulate freely
after three days detention at the port of arrival without evidence
of disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the United States the 90 days quarantine of cattle (dated
from the time of shipping at the foreign port), and the 15 days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>for sheep and other ruminants under strict veterinary supervision
is safe as regards the importation of cattle plague in live animals.
The greatest danger will doubtless come from intercourse with
the Phillipines, which were infected with the cattle plague during
the recent war. The greatest possible precautions as regards the
carriage of cattle on transports or other ships, will be necessary.
Not only should no Phillipine cattle be imported, but no vessel,
that has carried Phillipine cattle or sheep, should be allowed to
take on board home cattle nor other ruminants until it has been
thoroughly disinfected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cattle or sheep should be rejected when imported on ships
which, on the same voyage or a recent one, carried fresh hides or
other fresh products of animals, derived from a country in which
rinderpest exists.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hides that are thoroughly dried and salted, those that have
been freely exposed for one week to the sun and air, and such as
have been treated by active antiseptics, (caustic quicklime, mercuric
chloride, lime chloride, formalin, phenic acid, etc.), need
be held under no such restriction. The same applies to thoroughly
dried, sunned and aired hair, wool, hoofs, horns, bones and
sinews. Rendered tallow is equally safe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Extinction of Cattle Plague in a Country.</i> This should never
be called for on the American Continent. The introduction of
such a deadly disease, with such a short period of incubation, and
such severe symptoms and rapid course, would argue a most reprehensible
carelessness, which it is to be hoped will never be shown
by the Federal Bureau of Animal Industry. Yet under the stress
of a great European war this plague invariably overleaps the
barriers successfully maintained in time of peace, and the same
has happened to the two great English-speaking powers in connection
with the wars in South Africa and the Phillipines respectively
and therefore it cannot be said that importation is impossible
under any possible circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of a recent importation the infection would be easily
controlled. Trace at once to its destination every bovine animal
and other ruminant that arrived on the infected vessel, and all
that came in contact with them since, or with the gangways,
wharfs, streets, highways, yards, houses, fields, cars, loading
banks and other places and things that might have been contaminated;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>stop all cattle and sheep traffic or movement for a large
area around each centre of possible infection caused by such
cattle; remorselessly kill every head of such animals carried by
such vessel, or that came in direct contact with them; bury, burn,
boil or dissolve in mineral acids, every animal thus exposed;
thoroughly disinfect the importing ship, and every house, place
or thing the imported stock came in contact with, together with
all the dejections and debris, and even the surface of the graves;
make a census of all cattle within the different quarantined areas,
and hold the owners or custodians responsible, under a heavy
penalty, to report every death and every case of illness; whenever
the cattle plague is found in a place dispose of the entire herd as
has already been done with the infected imported stock, and in a
very few weeks the plague can be completely extirpated. The
violence of the individual attack, and the very short period of
latency, makes the work incomparably easier than the extinction
of lung plague. There is never a long period of uncertainty
(incubation), there is virtually never a slight or occult case of the
disease, there is no equivocal chronic form of the affection. The
attack is made boldly and above board, and can be met successfully
if met promptly and energetically. The danger in such cases
lies, less in the nature of the disease, than in the army of foolish,
even if well meaning, meddlers, who denounce the temporary
interference of trade, the payment of indemnities to the cattle
owners, the interference with private property, the destruction of
valuable thoroughbred herds, the interruption of the dairyman’s
business, the cost of disinfection, and a thousand other things,
and who too often succeed in hampering and delaying action,
until the infection has reached and spread over great unfenced
territories thereby getting beyond control, or, short of this, has so
established itself as to necessitate the outlay of a hundred thousand
for every hundred that would have been demanded at first,
and a long continued restriction of trade in place of the very transient
interruption required by early, sharp, decisive action.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most important prerequisites is that every state, but
especially those on the seaboard and with ports of entry, should
enact such laws as would make it possible for the Executive to
act at a moment’s notice and to call in the help of the Federal
Government to make an early and effective application of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>only successful remedy. Most things can wait for the call,
assembling and action of a legislature; the infection of cattle
plague can not. Such laws are not superfluous. If never called
for they still show a wise provision against a terrible, though
remote, possibility; if really called for and they are not found
ready, the great cattle industry and even the agriculture of the
continent may be largely sacrificed by the neglect.</p>

<p class='c008'>As guardian of the interests of The Philippines the United
States is to-day called upon to consider the question of exterminating
the disease which our interference brought upon the
islands. On the unfenced lands of these islands we have to face
on a smaller scale the problem of stamping out the plague which
has baffled the wisdom of Europe and Asia. The individual
islands may perhaps be taken independently, the cattle collected
in small herds under fence, and by the sacrifice of a few the remainder
of any herd that shows infection may be immunized,
and the premises where they are confined disinfected until finally
no more cases occur. But whatever method is adopted the seclusion
of all within well fenced areas is the most important consideration.
No nation has ever succeeded in extirpating this nor
any other important infection in animals when they are allowed
to run at large and mingle freely, herd with herd, on unfenced
land.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>PICTOU CATTLE DISEASE. HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is a fatal affection of cattle met with in the counties of
Pictou and Antigonish, Nova Scotia, which seems to make a slow
extension from farm to farm, but does not spread widely after the
manner of a disease propagated by contagion alone, apart from
other concurrent causes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Alleged Causes.</i> E. F. Thayer (1880) tells us that the inhabitants
traced its origin to the arrival from Scotland, about 1853,
of a ship in earth ballast, containing the seeds of the common
ragweed of Europe (Ambrosia Artemisiæfolia), alleging that the
trouble extended with the extension of this weed. This plant
has a strong odor (it is known in Pictou as “Stinking Willie”),
and, like other plants shedding an abundance of odoriferous pollen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>has been charged with arousing “hay fever,” but though
very common in Europe it has never been charged with producing
anything like the Pictou cattle disease. The coincidence of the
plant and the disease is manifestly a mere accident. Professor
Lawson, of Halifax, investigated the flora of the district but was
unable to find any poisonous plant to which the mortality could
be attributed. D. McEachran tells us that many farms are
covered with the ragweed, so that it is abundant in the hay, yet
they are absolutely free from the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The idea of a mineral poison must be dismissed in the same
way. Pictou lies on the Silurian formation with abundant coal
fields, and the chemical analyses made for McEachran were entirely
fruitless of results.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wyatt Johnston investigated the question of communicability
by contagion from animal to animal, but he found that neither
contact, nor inoculation produced positive results. Nothing
positive has come of investigations into the possible microbiology
of the disease. In blood from the jugular vein of a cow suffering
from the disease, Thayer and McEachran found bacteria,
under an object glass magnifying 600 diameters. Wyatt Johnston,
“in a series of pretty exhaustive bacteriological examinations, in
which all the tissues, including the blood, the spleen, the kidneys,
lungs, and the fluids from the lymph glands” were employed,
failed to find any constant or characteristic organism.</p>

<p class='c008'>Attacks are very rare in winter, the disease usually appearing
in the warm summer months, from June to August, and after the
animals have been some time at pasture. This might lead to the
suspicion of bacteria or other microbe on the growing vegetation;
or of some insect enemy which, maturing at that season, transfers
the poison from animal or other source to animal; or of some
poison, vegetable or mineral, which acts injuriously on the liver,
and which can only be had in the pasture. This, however, is
mere hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Liver affections are common in hot, damp seasons, but Pictou
and Antigonish do not differ in climate from other counties in
Nova Scotia, and much less do the infecting farms from those
adjacent.</p>

<p class='c008'>McEachran compares the disease to what occurs in the human
being during famines, from the ingestion of innutritious and unsuitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>agents especially deficient in albuminoids. The Pictou
farmers, being nearly all fishermen, neglect the farms during the
summer season, so that hay is only cut after the seeds have been
shed, and when little nutritive matter is left in the stalks. Almost
all the cases he saw were on such neglected farms. Wyatt Johnston,
however, found it equally prevalent in overfed animals, so
that hepatic disorder from either extreme seems to conduce to it.
Again, if caused by lack of nutrition in the hay, winter, rather
than summer, ought to be the season of attack and prevalence.
Starvation and excess may both favor the attack, but the gradual
extension from farm to farm, is strongly suggestive of the presence
of a specific cause—probably a living organism.</p>

<p class='c008'>The limitation of the disease to certain farms and even fields,
and the cirrhotic condition of the liver remind one of the
Schweinsberg disease of horses, and the lupinosis of sheep, in
which the poison is evidently the product of cryptogamic or bacterial
growth. With the damp, foggy climate of Nova Scotia, it
would not be surprising if it should be ultimately shown that the
source of the trouble is in a cryptogam which has as yet only invaded
a given limited area. The winter immunity would be
explainable on this basis. So also would be the statement of
Wyatt Johnston that “When it attacks a new farm it affects
chiefly animals that have been on the farm for two or three
years. By the end of the second year it kills or attacks 10 per
cent., and by the end of the third season it has practically involved
all the old cattle which have been allowed to remain on
the farm.” The hepatic disorder being a progressive one and
probably due to the toxic products of fermentations carried on
outside the animal body, a few only would show the morbid
results at first, while later, with advancing structural changes in
the liver, and an increase of the toxins that cause it, the number
of sick animals would steadily increase.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The animal is at first dull and sluggish, with
drooping head, lusterless eyes, staring coat, normal respiration
and temperature, pulse often about 60 per minute, relaxed bowels
and marked diminution of the milk secretion. The milk acquires
a bitter taste and unpleasant odor. The pulse is usually full and
soft, and the eyeballs may bulge visibly out of the sockets. The
diarrhœa tends to encrease, the stools becoming liquid and black,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>yet in exceptional cases the bowels are confined for the first four
or five days, or even permanently, appearing to be completely
paretic. By the end of a week the abdomen becomes full and
pendent with hollow flanks (pot bellied), or even rounded and
tense, while manipulation and percussion show an abundant exudation
into the peritoneal cavity. The pulse encreases in frequency
(80) but the temperature is not elevated unless there
is concurrent sepsis (Johnston). Thayer quotes an advanced
case with a temperature of 105° F. He also notes obstinate
standing, trembling of the muscles of the hind limbs, and complete
suppression of appetite and milk secretion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The disease is essentially chronic, often lasting a number of
months. Many cases are doubtless slightly affected before external
symptoms are manifested.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> If the disease has resulted in death there is usually
marked emaciation, yet the abdomen is distended by accumulation
of a clear yellowish fluid. From six to nine or more gallons
may be present. The fat of the omentum, mesentery and sublumbar
region has disappeared and the connective tissue is distended
by a clear, amber-colored, watery fluid. The liver is the
seat of marked changes. In the early stages it is congested and
the gall ducts and bladder are filled to repletion with a thick, dark
colored bile, which is further present in abundance in the intestines.
In these early stages Johnston found cloudy swelling and
opacity of the hepatic cells; somewhat later they had undergone
distinct fatty degeneration. In the advanced stages, however, in
animals that had been ill for two or three months, there was distinct
fibrous degeneration, and compression and disappearance of
the normal liver cells, in other words, a condition of marked
cirrhosis, the result doubtless of the early congestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Johnston further notes the distension of the submucosa of the
fourth stomach at intervals by a clear, viscid, liquid exudate, so
that rounded swellings appear on the surface, and in some
instances, after a month’s illness, distinct ulcers are shown upon
the mucosa.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lungs, pleuræ, pericardium and nervous system, are usually
normal, unless in case of septic complication when petechiæ
and circumscribed blood extravasations may be seen.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention.</i> The Canadian government has gone to great
expense in buying and slaughtering the diseased cattle with no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>very evident good result. McEachran suggested the feeding of
oil cake and other albuminoid and oleaginous food to counteract
the alleged malnutrition, but Johnston’s cases in over fed animals
show that something more is demanded. Another suggestion
has been made to the effect that cattle should be exterminated in
the affected counties to remove the material necessary for the
maintenance of the poison. But, if the poison is produced by a
cryptogam growing on the vegetation, as seems not improbable,
it would be likely to extend all the same in the absence of cattle.
In such a case the true course is to study the nature of the organism,
and the phanerogam on which it grows, when it might become
possible either to exterminate the flowering plant which acts as a
host for the offending organism, or to spray it with an effective
fungicide and thus reach the object in another way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>INFECTIVE GASTRO-ENTERITIS AND PNEUMONIA IN THE NEW BORN; WHITE SCOUR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In treating of this disease in Vol. II, page 141–2, the work of
Jensen, Perroncito and Nikolski is quoted, with the remark that
“<i>it is premature to specify any particular microbe as the sole cause
of the affection</i>.” Since the publication of that volume, Nocard,
investigating in Ireland a very prevalent and fatal affection of
new born calves, which proved fatal by “white scour” a few
days after birth, or by pneumonia one or two weeks later, identified
as the pathogenic agent a small, nonmotile, ovoid bacterium,
taking the polar aniline stain, bleaching in Gram’s solution, failing
to liquefy gelatine, or to form indol or to grow on potato.
In other words it shows the general characters of the colon group
of bacteria, causative of hæmorrhagic septicæmia, and classed as
<i>pasteurellas</i> by Trevisan and Lignieres. This is not found in
blood and lesions in all subjects, but is usually present in pure
culture in the most acute, fatal cases. Its occasional absence later
in the disease is explained, according to Lignieres, by the power
possessed by these germs of robbing the healthy tissues of their
power of resistance and laying them open to the attacks of other
microörganisms which are usually present in abundance, but are
harmless to the healthy tissues in the absence of the Pasteurella.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>As the disease advances, therefore, the primary pathogenic
agent (the Pasteurella) is crowded out by the active growth of
other bacteria, which accordingly are found in complex cultures
and in great variety. In his first observations on the victims of
the <i>white scour</i>, Nocard found only these complex cultures, of
which no one variety, isolated in pure cultures <i>in vitro</i>, and inoculated,
proved capable of causing the disease. Later he found
the Pasteurella (cocco-bacillus) in impure cultures from the diseased
femoro-tibial joint of one of the subjects of the affection,
and the pure cultures obtained from this were virulently infective.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few drops injected into the peritoneum of a Guinea pig, or
veins of a rabbit, killed in six to eighteen hours with the lesions
of hæmorrhagic septicæmia which characterize the most acute
cases of <i>white scour</i>. The blood and viscera swarmed with the
microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>A calf one day old had 3cc. of the culture injected into the jugular,
the temperature rose in six hours, and in twenty hours the
subject lay with sunken eye, retracted abdomen, a temperature of
95° F., and having the bed saturated with a yellowish, fœtid,
fæcal liquid. Death took place 30.5 hours after the injection and
all the lesions of acute <i>white scour</i> were met with.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second calf four weeks old, which had already suffered from
<i>white scour</i> and recovered, had an injection into the jugular of
10cc. of the same culture. In six hours he suffered a slight rise
of temperature, was dull and breathed short, but in twenty hours
he was completely recovered, full of life and appetite.</p>

<p class='c008'>In other casual and experimental cases, Nocard found that
when death occurred within one or two days the symptoms and
lesions were mainly those of hæmorrhagic septicæmia and <i>white
scour</i>, whereas if the calf survived several days, the impaired resistance
of the tissues invited the invasion of a variety of other
germs from the intestines, and infective inflammation of the
lungs, joints and other organs were brought about by such secondary
invasions.</p>

<p class='c008'>An important question is as to the direct source of the primary
(Pasteurella) infection. The concentration of the acute cases on
the alimentary canal would strongly suggest infection through the
food which in this case means the milk. But careful bacteriological
examination of the milk of the dam of a calf that had just died of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_647'>647</span><i>white scour</i>, and of other milk secured with careful precautions
from cows in an infected stable, showed that both were clear of
the germ. Inoculations and culture experiments were equally
fruitless.</p>

<p class='c008'>This does not exclude the probability of the contamination of
the milk, obtained under ordinary conditions, with the germ contained
in the floating barn dust, or that which was adherent to the
teat and udder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another suggestion is that the infection is derived from the infected
womb prior to birth, but as Nocard justly says, if this
were so, abortions would be much more prevalent, as the rapidly
fatal issue of the disease would determine the prompt death of the
fœtus and its expulsion. The coincidence of abortion and <i>white
scour</i> in a herd is not uncommon, and in such cases intrauterine
infection of the fœtus is not improbable, but in the great majority
of cases no such coincidence exists.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are thus thrown back on infection through the raw surface
of the ruptured umbilical cord, as the rule in such cases. It may
be that this has come from the vagina or vulva, but in the great
majority of cases it is manifestly derived from the infecting
bowel dejections and the dust caused by their desiccation. The
extraordinarily rapid progress and fatal result of the acute
disease, and the early abundance of the germ in the blood and
liver, suggest that the microbe traverses the umbilical vein to the
liver, and finding a congenial home in the blood is quickly distributed
through the entire body.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention</i> must be based on the destruction and exclusion of
the microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>A thorough disinfection of the stable with mercuric chloride
has not given us uniformly satisfactory results, even when the
building has been kept apparently almost immaculately clean.
This argues a renewed infection through the fæces of the cows,
yet it is the rule that the removal of the cow to a new or unused
stable a few days before calving will usually secure the immunity
of the calf. This method is however open to the objection
that the removal to such calving stable of a succession of
cows coming from infected premises soon introduces the infection
and renders it as dangerous as the place they have left. To carry
out such a plan therefore a number of new stables or sheds must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>be provided to be used in succession, as they become one by one
contaminated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nocard confines his instructions to the antisepsis of parturition
and of the offspring:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cows ready to calve should be provided with dry and clean
bedding until after the birth of the calf.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As soon as labor sets in, the vulva, anus and perineum
should be cleaned with a tepid solution of lysol in rain water:
20 grammes of lysol to each litre of water. The vagina should
also be cleansed by injecting with a large syringe a great quantity
of the same solution tepid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As far as possible the calf should be received on a clean cloth
or on a thick fresh bedding, not soiled by urine or fæces.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The cord should be tied immediately after birth, with a ligature
kept in a lysol solution, and the cord amputated below the
ligature.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The stump of the cord and the umbilicus should be washed
with the following solution:</p>

<table class='table0'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>Rain water</td>
    <td class='c030'>1 litre.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>Iodine crystals</td>
    <td class='c030'>2 grammes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>Potassium iodide</td>
    <td class='c030'>2 grammes.”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'>“The disinfection of the umbilicus and cord should be completed
by coating them with</p>

<table class='table0'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>Methylic alcohol</td>
    <td class='c030'>1 litre.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>Iodine crystals</td>
    <td class='c030'>2 grammes.”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'>“When the alcohol has evaporated the cord and umbilicus
should be covered with a thick layer of iodine collodion (1 per
cent.) applied with a brush. When the collodion has dried the
calf may be left to the care of the dam.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This treatment may be changed by substituting other antiseptics,
and by prompt separation of the calf from the infected stable
and dam. It is also important to disinfect thoroughly and often
the cow stable and calf-pen, to remove instantly any calf that
may show signs of scouring or general disorder and to purify its
pen and leave it unoccupied for some time.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be added that the period of danger is in the first few
days after birth, and while the umbilicus is still unhealed. If
scouring should come on later it is much more amenable to treatment.
A seclusion of the calf for one week is usually sufficient
to secure its escape.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>NOTE ON BACTERIOLOGY AND TREATMENT OF HÆMOGLOBINÆMIA IN THE HORSE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As supplementary to the article on hæmoglobinæmia (vol. II.,
page 437) the later bacteriological investigations of Lignieres
must be noted. A superb Percheron, after two days of idleness,
went to work at 10 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, was attacked at 1 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> and died at 3 <span class='fss'>P.
M.</span> Inoculations from blood, spleen, liver, kidney, bone marrow,
myelon and subarachnoid fluid from the loins to the bulb
proved sterile, excepting that made from the subarachnoid liquid
on a level with the bulb, which yielded a rich culture of a streptococcus
that appeared to the eye as small granules. It proved
ærobic and anærobic, stained well with Gram’s (I) solution, coagulated
milk, acidified the culture, formed small, round, grayish
white colonies on peptonized gelatine, without liquefying, failed
to propagate on potatoes, but grew well in serum and bouillon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two or three drops proved fatal to mice, producing, when
thrown into the peritoneum a highly acute parenchymatous nephritis
with bloody urine. Very few microbes were found in the
kidney. There was loss of control of the hind limbs and extreme
nervous irritability.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intravenous injection of 300cc. of the culture in a powerful
stallion produced hyperthermia, 102° F. on the second day, 104°
on the third, 105° on the fourth, on the sixth day he became
paraplegic and died on the seventh.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second horse, which received 150cc., was sick for several
days, but without paraplegia, then appeared to recover, but three
weeks after he became paraplegic with albuminous urine and died
next day.</p>

<p class='c008'>In neither of the horses was the urine sanguineous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carnivora, swine, ruminants and birds proved insusceptible.
The guinea pig succumbed to intraperitoneal inoculation, and the
rabbit to intravenous.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is to be noted that hæmoglobinuria was lacking in both experimental
equine cases, and though this may be so in mild casual
cases, the same is not true of violent and fatal ones. It is, therefore,
evident that further research is necessary in this direction.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_650'>650</span>Accepting the conclusions reached by Lignieres, we are still debarred
from entering the affection in the list of animal plagues
proper, to be met by official restrictions. The streptococcus may
be an essential condition in each case of the disease, or it may be
one of several microbes that may act in the causation, yet the microbe
in ordinary doses as accidentally introduced, does not prove
pathogenic excepting in the presence of concurrent conditions of
high feeding and condition, work, interrupted by one or more
days of absolute idleness, and the resumption of exercise. The
presence of the microbe is not enough to cause the disease in the
horse in continuous work, nor in that which is kept in the stable
all the time, nor even in the horse that has worked steadily and
then stood idle for a day, until he again goes to work. One animal
or a few only out of a stable, are attacked, and there is no
such active extension from animal to animal in the vicinity that
characterizes the plagues proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>prevention</i> of the disease, therefore, must be sought along
the lines previously laid down and well understood, in the avoidance
of sudden plethora, of transient idleness during a period of
high condition and steady work, and of gradual restoration to
work after such period of rest. Similarly the <i>treatment</i> by rest,
depletion, diluents, evacuants, and nerve sedatives is still in order.
A new importance, however, attaches to the use of nerve sedatives
and antiseptics, as calculated to prove a check on the disorder of
the nervous structure and functions and on the active proliferation
of the microbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The presence of the streptococcus may also contribute, along
with the permanent changes in the nerve structure, in predisposing
to relapses or second attacks, which are so common unless
the animal which has once suffered is subjected to very special care.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a fruit of the research by Lignieres, W. A. McClanahan,
Redding, Ia., essayed internal antisepsis by ½ oz. doses of potassium
iodide. In three severe cases relief was obtained in 15 to
20 minutes and an early and complete convalescence followed.
In the hands of J. H. Kelly of New Haven, Conn., and T. S.
Childs of Saratoga, N. Y., it seemed to prove equally successful,
the first meeting with almost invariable success, and the latter
reporting a series of 10 successive cases, several of them severe,
which all recovered in from 1 to 5 days. The only untoward result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_651'>651</span>was an open knee joint in one subject, the result of bruises
sustained before Dr. Childs arrived. His treatment was ½ oz.
of the iodide at once, and 1 to 2 drs. every hour or second hour,
according to the size of the animal and the severity of the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>In other hands this medication has been less successful, which
may well be explained by the violence of the attacks, and the
lack of absorption from the inactive stomach. Unless it passed
on to the duodenum, it would be utterly useless, and hence the
exhibition by the rectum or subcutem might be tried. The
parallelism of the treatment of the two diseases of the plethoric
and possibly infected subject,—parturient paresis and hæmoglobinæmia,—is
striking, and it does not seem that the iodide treatment
should be abandoned because of a few unsuccessful cases.
Whether the iodide acts mainly as a microbicide, a chemical antidote
to toxins, an eliminant, or a nerve sedative, or in two or
more of these modes, is unknown, but it would be rational to expect
good results along one or more of these lines. Iodide treatment
should supplement, not supersede, the methods formerly in
use.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>INFECTIVE ULCERATION OF ANUS AND VULVA IN CATTLE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This curious affection is recorded as having prevailed in the
winter of 1897–8 in different localities in Iowa, Missouri, Kansas
and Nebraska. In 1900 and 1901 it was again reported in different
parts of Iowa.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causation.</i> No bacteriology of the disease has been given, and
its appearance in isolated herds which had no known communication
with other herds, and even in the young cattle on a farm
to the exclusion of the older ones, seems to suggest an enzoötic
origin, perhaps in food or water, or in some toxin determined by
a fermentation of organic matter out of the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the Rodkey farm at Blue Rapids, Marshall county, Kan.,
eight heifers from ten to fourteen months old, suffered, while the
seventeen steers of the same age and the milch cows escaped.
(Steddom). Near Shelby, Ia., a bull, from a healthy herd,
broke into an affected herd and served cows there, and was afterward
returned to his own herd and served cows there, but did
not communicate the disease. (S. T. Miller). No case is recorded
to show that any bull serving affected cows or heifers contracted
ulcer or other disease of sheath or penis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>In one herd near Shelby, Ia., nineteen head of cows and heifers
suffered, while the four steers in the herd escaped. In another
herd of twenty-six head, in the same district, the four cows
and eight of the twenty-two steers suffered. It is not, therefore,
confined to the females. (S. T. Miller).</p>

<p class='c008'>In all cases the disease appeared in the cooler months, from
October to April inclusive, and while the cattle were secluded in
muddy yards.</p>

<p class='c008'>In different cases they occupied the yards in common with
swine which were charged with wounding the vulva, until the
general character of the outbreak forbade this conclusion. At
Blue Rapids it was sixty-two days after they had been yarded
with the hogs before the disease was observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this case the lot was small, poorly drained and very muddy
most of the time. Calves and hogs drank from the same troughs
until the disease appeared. The water supplied to the calves and
hogs was from a well sixteen feet deep. The cows, which
escaped, were supplied with water from the Blue River.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cows, heifers and steers were fed on a ration of shelled corn 6
parts, rye 1 part, oats 1 part, and had an abundance of fodder,
consisting of prairie hay and millet in equal parts. They were in
good condition, some of them fat, and nearly all dehorned. A
second herd had shelled corn, kafir corn and cane, with water
from a shallow well, and all (cows and heifers) suffered.</p>

<p class='c008'>As showing the localized nature of the cause, C. Muller adduces
the case near Ottumwa, Ia., in which a herd of 30 calves were
attacked, and sold out, the owner filling the same yard a few days
later with 30 more bought in the surrounding country, and which
he put on the same rations. In about 10 days the disease appeared
in the second lot.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the Rice farm, Blue Rapids, were 60 yearling heifers, bought
in Kansas City, and two home cows. In the first week after
arrival 5 heifers suffered, in the second week 20, in the third
week 40, and in the fourth week all the 60. The two cows
mingling with them were only slightly affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Rodkey farm, Blue Rapids, cases, all of the young cattle
(which alone suffered) had been raised on the farm and had not
been exposed to outside cattle.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> “The ulcer, in almost every case, started as a mere
abrasion, the size of a pinhead, usually on the inner surface of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span>the labia, near the border of the inferior commissure, gradually
eating its way through until it appeared as a much larger denuded
surface on the outside” (C. Miller). S. T. Miller says: “The
first noticeable symptom was serous exudate, rapidly forming into
a brown scab, under which was very fœtid pus, with extensive
inflammation. The affection usually occurred on the lower portion
of the lips of the vulva, in heifers and cows, and in steers around
the anus or root of the tail. The scabs which formed seemed to
spread very rapidly, destroying more and more of the underlying
tissue and forming a thicker and thicker scab. The scab, if
pulled off, would expose a raw surface which would bleed very
readily. In a short time a new scab would be formed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Steddom says: “The vulvar lips thickened and continued to
discharge for four or five days. In the meantime certain pustules
appeared, 0.1 to 2.5 centimeters in diameter. About the fifth day
these ruptured and discharged yellowish pus.” The mucous
membranes of the vulva and vagina were dry and slightly congested.
The ulcers were covered with brown leathery scabs,
which adhered tenaciously and when detached left an angry, red,
purulent, granular, elevated and pitted surface. In some of the
more severe cases, one or both lips of the vulva had sloughed off,
and the sore had extended 10 to 15 centimeters on the skin of the
escutcheon. The pus from this sore did not corrode the adjacent
skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The more severe cases showed loss of appetite, constipation,
hurried breathing, tucking up of the abdomen, with general dulness
and dejection, and great tenderness of the affected skin with
stiff, straddling gait.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pathology.</i> This is very obscure. The primary cause of the
sores is not evident, though their occurrence on the anus and
vulva only, and especially on the latter would suggest an elective
affinity of the poison (microbian or chemical) for these structures
and their products. If we assume a pathogenic microbe in the
fæces, the question arises as to the cause of the habitual immunity
of the steer, and of the margin of the anus in the majority of the
affected heifers. The susceptibility of heifers rather than cows
may imply a previous exposure and acquired immunity on the
part of the mature animal.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>Again if we suspect the existence of a necrobiotic agent of
organic origin (like ergotin, secalin, sphacelin) we must assume
a superadded microbian infection, implanted in the primary sore
and rapidly extending it. The prompt recovery under antiseptic
treatment shows that no mere chemical poison maintains the
destructive process, for it is manifestly the microbicide which puts
a prompt limit to the disease, and under such treatment no
sphacelating agent in the blood or tissues keeps up the advance
of the ulceration or prevents healing.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i> The ulcers healed rapidly under cleanliness and
antiseptic applications. The tail, anus, and vulva were washed
with tepid water, and then dressed with a solution of creolin
(5:100), or carbolic acid (3:100), or mercuric chloride (1:500 or
1000). The ulcers were touched with a pencil of silver nitrate.
S. T. Miller followed the sublimate lotion by the subjoined ointment:
iodoform 20 grains, eucalyptol 40 minims, phenic acid 20
minims, petrolatum enough to make 2 oz. C. Miller in addition
to the carbolic acid lotion applied the common white lotion (zinc
sulphate 1 oz., lead acetate 1 oz., water 1 qt.) and used silver
nitrate on the ulcers. Four dressings on four successive days were
given and in the milder cases healing was completed in 10 or 12
days.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>NOTE ON GOOSE SEPTICÆMIA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>As these pages are going through the press, Cooper Curtice’s
bulletin on <i>Goose Septicæmia</i> comes to hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>This affection in 1900 caused a loss of 3,200 geese in July and
August to Mr. Cornell, a Rhode Island owner. Mr. Snell lost
500.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Bacteriology.</i> The blood and tissues swarmed with a minute
bacillus having the general morphological staining and biological
characters of that of chicken cholera and rabbit septicæmia.
It differed from these in the failure to infect chickens, whether
inoculated or fed to them. It proved deadly to geese, ducks,
pigeons, rabbits, mice, and more slowly to Guinea pigs. Geese
were infected by inoculation or feeding of the germs, ducks from
inoculation only.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i> The geese were often found dead, and even in those
noticed ill, death supervened so early that no very diagnostic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>symptoms were made out. The affected geese moved tardily and
unsteadily, and failed to keep with the remainder of the flock.
Some burrowed the head in the dirt and twisted it around, indicating,
it was supposed, spasms of the throat. Some were seized
with the death agony in a few minutes; in others the illness
lasted for hours, and from experimental cases it was concluded
that the period from infection to death, in the majority of cases,
did not exceed thirty-six hours. Some were believed to merge
into a chronic condition, but the owner thought that none recovered.
No diarrhœa is noted.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lesions.</i> The head was the seat of marked venous and capillary
congestion, suggesting asphyxia. The bill and throat contained
a large quantity of tenacious mucus, which was especially
viscid in the nose. Extravasated blood in abundance was present
in the gastro-intestinal mucosa and contents, much of it more or
less digested. At some points there was abundant mucous exudate;
at others the folds were only marked by punctiform
petechiæ, or by bloody patches formed by their coalescence. The
cæca were usually normal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The liver showed numerous punctiform extravasations and yellow
patches of necrosis extending more or less deeply into the
hepatic tissue. Other congestions were seen in individual cases,
implicating, in one instance, the heart and pericardium, and in
another the lungs. Petechiæ were frequent on the pericardium
and other mucosæ. The blood was usually black, tarry, and
with little disposition to brighten on exposure to the air.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Diagnosis.</i> It is recognized as an infection of domestic water
fowl by its attacking the larger proportion of that class of animals
exposed to it. It is supposed that those which escape do so
because of immunity due to a previous attack, or by reason of the
absence of any wound of the mouth, throat or stomach by which
the germ might enter. It is distinguished from <i>fowl</i> (<i>chicken</i>)
<i>cholera</i> by the immunity of the chicken in this case. It is differentiated
from Klein’s <i>diarrhœal enteritis</i> of fowls, by the fact that
neither pigeon nor rabbit is immune. From the <i>duck cholera</i> of
Cornil and Loupet, it is diagnosed by the immunity of the chicken
only, while the rodents and pigeon suffer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The germ is manifestly one of the family of bacilli of the colon
group, found in the different septicæmias, but sufficiently distinctive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>from these other forms, in its pathogenesis, to demand a
separate place in connection with sanitary work.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment</i> is hopeless from our present point of view.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Prevention</i> is the rational resort. In the case of those raising
geese from the egg, it is imperative to abandon, for the season at
least, any pastures that may have become contaminated. It
would be better still to subject such pastures to cultivated crops
for one or two years. The pens should be thoroughly disinfected
or abandoned and burned. Mr. Cornell used his infected pens
for ducks without evil result. The drainage from infected pastures
or pens must be guarded against, no geese nor ducks being
allowed on land through which, or on which it passes, and no
water receiving such drainage being employed for geese. In the
case of feeders or handlers of geese who buy the birds in large
numbers from many sources, a subsidiary quarantine should be
constantly maintained, by enclosing the birds in as small groups
as possible in separate pens, so that infection in one pen will not
endanger the whole flock. When infection is shown in a pen,
the diseased birds should be at once destroyed and burned, the
pen thoroughly disinfected, and the other birds returned, or better,
divided up into still smaller lots, so that infection showing in one
of these will not endanger the great number taken from the original
infected pen. The utmost care should be taken to maintain
the most perfect cleanliness in the pens of exposed and suspected
geese, and to sprinkle the floors and manure liberally with an
antiseptic, such as a solution of sulphuric acid in water (2:100),
or of phenic acid (3:100), or of a combination of the two. This
will do much to prevent the hatching of flies to act as infection-bearers,
and if these can be further excluded by screens the condition
will be still more satisfactory. Vermin of all kinds should
be excluded and whenever possible, separate feeders and attendants
should be furnished for the suspected geese, and those that
have not been exposed.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>NOTE ON HÆMORRHAGIC SEPTICÆMIA IN CHICKENS AND TURKEYS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Lucet describes a septicæmia of chickens and turkeys accompanied
by dysenteric discharges. The microbe resembles the
bacillus gallinarum of Klein (see Vol. II, p. 254), even in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span>immunity of pigeons and rabbits when injected subcutem. Rabbits,
however, suffer when injected intravenously. The probability
is that this bacillus is identical with that of Klein. Yet in
this whole class of microbes of the colon group, variations, apparently
superinduced by environment, appear to result at times in
a deadly pathogenesis for different genera, and epizoötics differing
from each other.</p>
